If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.

PENDING: The operation in the specified account and Region has yet to start.    RUNNING: The operation in the specified account and Region is currently in progress.    SUCCEEDED: The operation in the specified account and Region completed successfully.
