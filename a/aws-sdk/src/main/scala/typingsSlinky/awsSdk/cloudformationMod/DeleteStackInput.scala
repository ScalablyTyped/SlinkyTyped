    * A unique identifier for this DeleteStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might retry DeleteStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
