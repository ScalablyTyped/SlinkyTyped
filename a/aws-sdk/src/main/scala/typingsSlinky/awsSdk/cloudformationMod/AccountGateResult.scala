SKIPPED: AWS CloudFormation has skipped calling the account gate function for this account and Region, for one of the following reasons:   An account gate function has not been specified for the account and Region. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region.   The AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole of the stack set adminstration account lacks permissions to invoke the function. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account and Region.   Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the stack.
