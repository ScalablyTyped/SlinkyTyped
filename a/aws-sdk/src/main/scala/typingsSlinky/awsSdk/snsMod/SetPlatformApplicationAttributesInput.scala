PlatformPrincipal – The principal received from the notification service. For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformPrincipal is SSL certificate. For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no PlatformPrincipal. For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is client id.

EventEndpointUpdated – Topic ARN to which EndpointUpdate event notifications are sent.    EventDeliveryFailure – Topic ARN to which DeliveryFailure event notifications are sent upon Direct Publish delivery failure (permanent) to one of the application's endpoints.    SuccessFeedbackRoleArn – IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.    FailureFeedbackRoleArn – IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.
