    * This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. If you want to include query strings in the cache key, use a cache policy.

If you want to send query strings to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see Creating origin request policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of QueryString and on the values that you specify for QueryStringCacheKeys, if any: If you specify true for QueryString and you don't specify any values for QueryStringCacheKeys, CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin. If you specify true for QueryString and you specify one or more values for QueryStringCacheKeys, CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify. If you specify false for QueryString, CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters. For more information, see Configuring CloudFront to Cache Based on Query String Parameters in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
