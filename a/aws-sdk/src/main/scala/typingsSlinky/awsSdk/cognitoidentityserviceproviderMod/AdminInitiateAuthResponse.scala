    * The name of the challenge which you are responding to with this call. This is returned to you in the AdminInitiateAuth response if you need to pass another challenge.    MFA_SETUP: If MFA is required, users who do not have at least one of the MFA methods set up are presented with an MFA_SETUP challenge. The user must set up at least one MFA type to continue to authenticate.    SELECT_MFA_TYPE: Selects the MFA type. Valid MFA options are SMS_MFA for text SMS MFA, and SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA for TOTP software token MFA.    SMS_MFA: Next challenge is to supply an SMS_MFA_CODE, delivered via SMS.    PASSWORD_VERIFIER: Next challenge is to supply PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE, PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK, and TIMESTAMP after the client-side SRP calculations.    CUSTOM_CHALLENGE: This is returned if your custom authentication flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before tokens are issued.    DEVICE_SRP_AUTH: If device tracking was enabled on your user pool and the previous challenges were passed, this challenge is returned so that Amazon Cognito can start tracking this device.    DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER: Similar to PASSWORD_VERIFIER, but for devices only.    ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH: This is returned if you need to authenticate with USERNAME and PASSWORD directly. An app client must be enabled to use this flow.    NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED: For users which are required to change their passwords after successful first login. This challenge should be passed with NEW_PASSWORD and any other required attributes.

The value of the USER_ID_FOR_SRP attribute will be the user's actual username, not an alias (such as email address or phone number), even if you specified an alias in your call to AdminInitiateAuth.
