For a WebHookFilter that uses any of the other filter types, a regular expression pattern.

  /**
    *  The type of webhook filter. There are six webhook filter types: EVENT, ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID, HEAD_REF, BASE_REF, FILE_PATH, and COMMIT_MESSAGE.    EVENT    A webhook event triggers a build when the provided pattern matches one of five event types: PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED, PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED, and PULL_REQUEST_MERGED. The EVENT patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example, PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED filters all push, pull request created, and pull request updated events.    The PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise only.     ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID    A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression pattern.    HEAD_REF    A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression pattern. For example, refs/heads/branch-name and refs/tags/tag-name.   Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events.    BASE_REF    A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression pattern. For example, refs/heads/branch-name.    Works with pull request events only.     FILE_PATH    A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression pattern.    Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events.    COMMIT_MESSAGE  A webhook triggers a build when the head commit message matches the regular expression pattern.   Works with GitHub and Bitbucket events push and pull requests events. Also works with GitHub Enterprise push events, but does not work with GitHub Enterprise pull request events.
