    * Creates a display name for a customer managed customer master key (CMK). You can use an alias to identify a CMK in cryptographic operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey. You can change the CMK associated with the alias at any time. Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify your applications. For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can change the CMK your code uses by associating a given alias with a different CMK.  To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code, such as alias/ApplicationKey. Then, in each AWS Region, create an alias/ApplicationKey alias that is associated with a CMK in that Region. When you run your code, it uses the alias/ApplicationKey CMK for that AWS Region without any Region-specific code. This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the ListAliases operation. To use aliases successfully, be aware of the following information.   Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias and its associated CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region.    You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS account and Region. However, you do not have permission to associate an alias with an AWS managed CMK or an AWS owned CMK.    To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the UpdateAlias operation. The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric) and they must have the same key usage (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY). This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases.   The alias name must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such as alias/ExampleAlias. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with alias/aws/. The alias/aws/ prefix is reserved for AWS managed CMKs.    The alias name must be unique within an AWS Region. However, you can use the same alias name in multiple Regions of the same AWS account. Each instance of the alias is associated with a CMK in its Region.   After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name. However, you can use the DeleteAlias operation to delete the alias and then create a new alias with the desired name.   You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS KMS cryptographic operations and in the DescribeKey operation. However, you cannot use alias names or alias ARNs in API operations that manage CMKs, such as DisableKey or GetKeyPolicy. For information about the valid CMK identifiers for each AWS KMS API operation, see the descriptions of the KeyId parameter in the API operation documentation.

Symmetric CMKs  When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't need to specify the CustomerMasterKeySpec or KeyUsage parameters. The default value for CustomerMasterKeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default value for KeyUsage, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs.     Imported Key Material  To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL. Next, use GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see Importing Key Material in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . You cannot import the key material into an asymmetric CMK.    Custom Key Stores  To create a symmetric CMK in a custom key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to specify the custom key store. You must also use the Origin parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the AWS Region.

If you specify an EncryptionContext, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  How to use your data key  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application. You can write your own code or use a client-side encryption library, such as the AWS Encryption SDK, the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client, or Amazon S3 client-side encryption to do these tasks for you. To encrypt data outside of AWS KMS:   Use the GenerateDataKey operation to get a data key.   Use the plaintext data key (in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS. Then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   Store the encrypted data key (in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) with the encrypted data.   To decrypt data outside of AWS KMS:   Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.   Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of AWS KMS, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.

You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext. The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as Encrypt or GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS. When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must identify the source CMK, that is, the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.   It is optional, but you can specify a source CMK even when the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK. This ensures that the ciphertext is decrypted only by using a particular CMK. If the CMK that you specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the ReEncrypt operation fails.   To reencrypt the data, you must specify the destination CMK, that is, the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.    Unlike other AWS KMS API operations, ReEncrypt callers must have two permissions:    kms:ReEncryptFrom permission on the source CMK    kms:ReEncryptTo permission on the destination CMK   To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the "kms:ReEncrypt*" permission in your key policy. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK programmatically or when you use the PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy.

The current and new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric), and they must have the same key usage (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY). This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an alias to a different type of CMK, use DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias. You cannot use UpdateAlias to change an alias name. To change an alias name, use DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias. Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account, use the ListAliases operation.  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    * Changes the properties of a custom key store. Use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the custom key store you want to edit. Use the remaining parameters to change the properties of the custom key store. You can only update a custom key store that is disconnected. To disconnect the custom key store, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore. To reconnect the custom key store after the update completes, use ConnectCustomKeyStore. To find the connection state of a custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. Use the parameters of UpdateCustomKeyStore to edit your keystore settings.   Use the NewCustomKeyStoreName parameter to change the friendly name of the custom key store to the value that you specify.     Use the KeyStorePassword parameter tell AWS KMS the current password of the  kmsuser crypto user (CU) in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can use this parameter to fix connection failures that occur when AWS KMS cannot log into the associated cluster because the kmsuser password has changed. This value does not change the password in the AWS CloudHSM cluster.     Use the CloudHsmClusterId parameter to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can use this parameter to repair a custom key store if its AWS CloudHSM cluster becomes corrupted or is deleted, or when you need to create or restore a cluster from a backup.    If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties. This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

If the signature is verified, the value of the SignatureValid field in the response is True. If the signature verification fails, the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSignatureException exception. A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric CMK.

You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside of AWS KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS. The advantage of using the Verify operation is that it is performed within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the CMK to verify signatures.
