    * A detailed description of the progress within a secondary status.  Amazon SageMaker provides secondary statuses and status messages that apply to each of them:  Starting    Starting the training job.   Launching requested ML instances.   Insufficient capacity error from EC2 while launching instances, retrying!   Launched instance was unhealthy, replacing it!   Preparing the instances for training.    Training    Downloading the training image.   Training image download completed. Training in progress.      Status messages are subject to change. Therefore, we recommend not including them in code that programmatically initiates actions. For examples, don't use status messages in if statements.  To have an overview of your training job's progress, view TrainingJobStatus and SecondaryStatus in DescribeTrainingJob, and StatusMessage together. For example, at the start of a training job, you might see the following:    TrainingJobStatus - InProgress    SecondaryStatus - Training    StatusMessage - Downloading the training image
