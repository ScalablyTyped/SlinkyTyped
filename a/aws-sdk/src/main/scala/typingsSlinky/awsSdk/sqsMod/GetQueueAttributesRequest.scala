  /**
    * A list of attributes for which to retrieve information.  In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.  The following attributes are supported:  The ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed, ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible, and ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metrics may not achieve consistency until at least 1 minute after the producers stop sending messages. This period is required for the queue metadata to reach eventual consistency.      All – Returns all values.     ApproximateNumberOfMessages – Returns the approximate number of messages available for retrieval from the queue.    ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed – Returns the approximate number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter.    ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible – Returns the approximate number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered to be in flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window.     CreatedTimestamp – Returns the time when the queue was created in seconds (epoch time).    DelaySeconds – Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds.    LastModifiedTimestamp – Returns the time when the queue was last changed in seconds (epoch time).    MaximumMessageSize – Returns the limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.    MessageRetentionPeriod – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message.    Policy – Returns the policy of the queue.    QueueArn – Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue.    ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which the ReceiveMessage action waits for a message to arrive.     RedrivePolicy – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON object. For more information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.    deadLetterTargetArn – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.    maxReceiveCount – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.      VisibilityTimeout – Returns the visibility timeout for the queue. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.    The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – Returns the ID of an AWS-managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms.     KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?.    The following attributes apply only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues:    FifoQueue – Returns whether the queue is FIFO. For more information, see FIFO Queue Logic in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.  To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether QueueName ends with the .fifo suffix.     ContentBasedDeduplication – Returns whether content-based deduplication is enabled for the queue. For more information, see Exactly-Once Processing in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.
