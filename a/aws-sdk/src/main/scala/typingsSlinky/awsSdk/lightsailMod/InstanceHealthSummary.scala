Lb.InitialHealthChecking  - The Lightsail load balancer is still sending the target instance the minimum number of health checks required to determine its health status.   If  instanceHealth  is unhealthy, the  instanceHealthReason  value can be one of the following:     Instance.ResponseCodeMismatch  - The health checks did not return an expected HTTP code.     Instance.Timeout  - The health check requests timed out.     Instance.FailedHealthChecks  - The health checks failed because the connection to the target instance timed out, the target instance response was malformed, or the target instance failed the health check for an unknown reason.     Lb.InternalError  - The health checks failed due to an internal error.   If  instanceHealth  is unused, the  instanceHealthReason  value can be one of the following:     Instance.NotRegistered  - The target instance is not registered with the target group.     Instance.NotInUse  - The target group is not used by any load balancer, or the target instance is in an Availability Zone that is not enabled for its load balancer.     Instance.IpUnusable  - The target IP address is reserved for use by a Lightsail load balancer.     Instance.InvalidState  - The target is in the stopped or terminated state.   If  instanceHealth  is draining, the  instanceHealthReason  value can be one of the following:     Instance.DeregistrationInProgress  - The target instance is in the process of being deregistered and the deregistration delay period has not expired.
