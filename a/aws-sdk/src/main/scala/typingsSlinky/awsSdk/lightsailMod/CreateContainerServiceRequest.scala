If you don't specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service.  You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service.

Must contain 1 to 63 characters.   Must contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.   A hyphen (-) can separate words but cannot be at the start or end of the name.
