It is always sent from the management account to only invited member accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those accounts were created by the organization's management account and approval is inferred.    APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES: This type of handshake is sent from the Organizations service when all member accounts have approved the ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES invitation. It is sent only to the management account and signals the master that it can finalize the process to enable all features.

OPEN: This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action.    CANCELED: This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account.    ACCEPTED: This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient.    DECLINED: This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.    EXPIRED: This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days).
