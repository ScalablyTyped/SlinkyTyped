For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see Importing Certificates in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.   ACM does not provide managed renewal for certificates that you import.  Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:   You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.   The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.   If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.   If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.   The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.   The current time must be between the Not Before and Not After certificate fields.   The Issuer field must not be empty.   The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.   To import a new certificate, omit the CertificateArn argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certifica   When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by file://. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the C:\temp folder as file://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.    When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using.    The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.   This operation returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the imported certificate.
