For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. Use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see Cost Allocation and Tagging.  Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3 Bucket Tags.  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3-outposts:PutBucketTagging action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see  Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.

To modify the existing tag set, you can either replace the existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the existing tag set by retrieving the existing tag set using GetJobTagging, modify that tag set, and use this action to replace the tag set with the one you modified. For more information, see Controlling access and labeling jobs using tags in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.      If you send this request with an empty tag set, Amazon S3 deletes the existing tag set on the Batch Operations job. If you use this method, you are charged for a Tier 1 Request (PUT). For more information, see Amazon S3 pricing.   For deleting existing tags for your Batch Operations job, a DeleteJobTagging request is preferred because it achieves the same result without incurring charges.
