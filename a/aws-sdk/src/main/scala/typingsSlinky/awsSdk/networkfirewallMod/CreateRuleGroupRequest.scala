  /**
    * The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group.  You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling CreateRuleGroup with DryRun set to TRUE.   You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group, so leave room for your rule group to grow.    Capacity for a stateless rule group  For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.  To calculate the capacity requirement of a single rule, multiply the capacity requirement values of each of the rule's match settings:   A match setting with no criteria specified has a value of 1.    A match setting with Any specified has a value of 1.    All other match settings have a value equal to the number of elements provided in the setting. For example, a protocol setting ["UDP"] and a source setting ["10.0.0.0/24"] each have a value of 1. A protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"] has a value of 2. A source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a value of 3.    A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"], source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specification or no specification for each of the other match settings has a capacity requirement of 6.   Capacity for a stateful rule group  For a stateful rule group, the minimum capacity required is the number of individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.

You can provide your rule group specification in a file through this setting when you create or update your rule group.
