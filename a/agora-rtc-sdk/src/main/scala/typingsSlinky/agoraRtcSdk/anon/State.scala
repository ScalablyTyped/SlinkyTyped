    * - 3: The SDK fails to access the service, probably due to limited resources of the server.
    * - 4: Fails to send the relay request.
    * - 5: Fails to accept the relay request.
    * - 6: The server fails to receive the media stream.
    * - 7: The server fails to send the media stream.
    * - 8: The SDK disconnects from the server and fails to reconnect to the server due to a poor network connection. In this case, the SDK resets the relay state. You can try {@link startChannelMediaRelay} to restart the media stream relay.
    * - 9: An internal error occurs in the server.
    * - 10: The token of the source channel has expired.
    * - 11: The token of the destination channel has expired.
    * - 12: The relay has already started. Possibly caused by calling {@link startChannelMediaRelay} repeatedly, or calling {@link startChannelMediaRelay} before {@link stopChannelMediaRelay} succeeds.
    * - 13: The relay has not started. Possibly caused by calling {@link updateChannelMediaRelay} before {@link startChannelMediaRelay} succeeds.
