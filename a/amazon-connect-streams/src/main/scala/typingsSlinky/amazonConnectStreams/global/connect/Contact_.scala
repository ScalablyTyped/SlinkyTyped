/**
  * The Contact API provides event subscription methods and action methods which can be called on behalf of a specific contact.
  * Contacts come and go and so should these API objects.
  * It is good practice not to persist these objects or keep them as internal state.
  * If you need to, store the `contactId` of the contact and make sure that the contact still exists by fetching it from the `Agent` API object before calling methods on it.
