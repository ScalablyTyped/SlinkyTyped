  * The Connection API provides action methods (no event subscriptions) which can be called to manipulate the state of a particular connection within a contact.
  * Like contacts, connections come and go.
  * It is good practice not to persist these object or keep them as internal state.
  * If you need to, store the contactId and connectionId of the connection and make sure that the contact and connection still exist by fetching them in order from the Agent API object before calling methods on them.
