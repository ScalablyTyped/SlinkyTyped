/**
  * The `Router` is responsible for mapping URLs to components.
  *
  * You can see the state of the router by inspecting the read-only field `router.navigating`.
  * This may be useful for showing a spinner, for instance.
  *
  * ## Concepts
  *
  * Routers and component instances have a 1:1 correspondence.
  *
  * The router holds reference to a number of {@link RouterOutlet}.
  * An outlet is a placeholder that the router dynamically fills in depending on the current URL.
  *
  * When the router navigates from a URL, it must first recognize it and serialize it into an
  * `Instruction`.
  * The router uses the `RouteRegistry` to get an `Instruction`.
