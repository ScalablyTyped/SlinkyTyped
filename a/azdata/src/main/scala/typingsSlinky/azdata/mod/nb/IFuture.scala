    * processing pauses until the Thenable is fulfilled. If a hook return value
    * resolves to false, any later hooks will not run and the function will
    * return a Thenable resolving to false. If a hook throws an error, the error
    * is logged to the console and the next hook is run. If a hook is
    * registered during the hook processing, it will not run until the next
    * message. If a hook is removed during the hook processing, it will be
    * deactivated immediately.
