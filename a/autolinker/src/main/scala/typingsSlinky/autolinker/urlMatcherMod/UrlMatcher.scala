    *
    * A match may have an extra closing parenthesis at the end of the match
    * because the regular expression must include parenthesis for URLs such as
    * "wikipedia.com/something_(disambiguation)", which should be auto-linked.
    *

    *     "(wikipedia.com/something_(disambiguation))"
    * In this case, the last closing parenthesis should *not* be part of the
    * URL itself, and this method will return `true`.

    * For square brackets in URLs such as in PHP arrays, the same behavior as
    * parenthesis discussed above should happen:
    *     "[http://www.example.com/foo.php?bar[]=1&bar[]=2&bar[]=3]"

    * The regular expression to match URLs with an optional scheme, port
    * number, path, query string, and hash anchor.
    *
    * Example matches:
    *
    *     http://google.com
    *     www.google.com
    *     google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor

    * This regular expression will have the following capturing groups:
    *
    * 1.  Group that matches a scheme-prefixed URL (i.e. 'http://google.com').
    *     This is used to match scheme URLs with just a single word, such as
    *     'http://localhost', where we won't double check that the domain name
    *     has at least one dot ('.') in it.
    * 2.  Group that matches a 'www.' prefixed URL. This is only matched if the
    *     'www.' text was not prefixed by a scheme (i.e.: not prefixed by
    *     'http://', 'ftp:', etc.)
    * 3.  A protocol-relative ('//') match for the case of a 'www.' prefixed
    *     URL. Will be an empty string if it is not a protocol-relative match.
    *     We need to know the character before the '//' in order to determine
    *     if it is a valid match or the // was in a string we don't want to
    *     auto-link.
    * 4.  Group that matches a known TLD (top level domain), when a scheme
    *     or 'www.'-prefixed domain is not matched.
    * 5.  A protocol-relative ('//') match for the case of a known TLD prefixed
    *     URL. Will be an empty string if it is not a protocol-relative match.
    *     See #3 for more info.
