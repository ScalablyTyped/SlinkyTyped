/**
  * allows to exclicitly free resources and break cyclic references.
  *
  * Actually the real lifetime of an UNO object is controlled by references kept on interfaces of this object. But there are two distinct meanings in
  * keeping a reference to an interface: 1st to own the object and 2nd to know the object.
  *
  * You are only allowed to keep references of interfaces to UNO objects if you are by definition the owner of that object or your reference is very
  * temporary or you have registered an EventListener at that object and release the reference when "disposing" is called.

    * The object must notify all registered listeners using the method {@link XEventListener.disposing()} . All notfied objects should release there
    * references to this object without calling {@link XComponent.removeEventListener()} (the disposed object will release the listeners eitherway).
    *
    * After this method has been called, the object should behave as passive as possible, thus it should ignore all calls in case it can comply with its
    * specification (for instance {@link addEventListener()} ). Often the object can't fulfill its specification anymore, in this case it must throw the
    * {@link DisposedException} (which is derived from {@link com.sun.star.uno.RuntimeException} ) when it gets called.
    *
    * For some objects no real owner can be identified, thus it can be disposed from multiple reference holders. In this case the object should be able to
