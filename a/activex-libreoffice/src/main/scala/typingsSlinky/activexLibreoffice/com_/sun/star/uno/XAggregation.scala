/**
  * Objects which implement this interface can become aggregates of a delegator.
  *
  * That means if an object "A" aggregates "B", "A" can provide all or some of the interfaces of "B". Whenever the method {@link
  * XInterface.queryInterface()} is called on either of the objects, the call will be forwarded to object "A". Object "A" now can determine whether to use
  * the interfaces of "A" or "B" or neither. Actually, any number of aggregates can be used, even nested ones (aggregated objects which are delegators by
  * themselves).
  *
  * The following rules are to be observed:  1. All calls to {@link XInterface.acquire()} which are made before the delegator was set (using the method
  * {@link XAggregation.setDelegator()} ) must not be taken back (using the method {@link XInterface.release()} ) before the delegation is removed by
  * calling `xAggregation->setDelegator(NULL)` .
  *
  *  2. The constructor of a delegator has to increment its own reference count by calling its method {@link XInterface.acquire()} before it sets itself
  * to any aggregate using the method {@link XAggregation.setDelegator()} . After that call it has to reset its own reference count without the destructor
  * getting called.
  *
  *  3. The destructor of a delegator has to reset the delegator in its aggregated objects by calling their method {@link XAggregation.setDelegator()}
  * with NULL before it releases its reference to its aggregated objects.
  * @deprecated DeprecatedAggregation will no longer be supported as a high-level concept of UNO. You may still have the option to implement an UNO object consis
