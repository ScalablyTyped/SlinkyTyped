    *
    * The instantiation of the registered objects can be carried out by any ordinary mechanism which is used in a certain language to create COM components.
    * For example, `CreateObject` in Visual Basic, `CoCreateInstance` in C++.

    * {82154420-0FBF-11d4-8313-005004526AB4} and the ProgId is com.sun.star.ServiceManager.
    *
    * {@link ApplicationRegistration} does not provide any particular interface because the UNO objects are registered while instantiating this service and
    * deregistered if the implementation, which makes use of this service, is being released.

    * maps UNO types to oleautomation types and vice versa.

    * interface was mapped to `IDispatch` , then all objects (interfaces, structs) and other types which are obtained from that Automation object are
    * automatically mapped to the corresponding Automation types. Hence, if one provides an initial object which forms the root of all other objects, such
    * as a service manager, then only that object needs to be explicitly mapped by a call to {@link com.sun.star.bridge.XBridgeSupplier2.createBridge()} .
    * The same holds true if an automation object is mapped to an UNO interface.
    *
    * For Automation objects to be mapped they have to implement `IDispatch` interface. Other COM interfaces, except for `IUnknown` , are not supported. UNO
    * interfaces and structs are mapped to `IDispatch` .
    *
    * The service implements the {@link com.sun.star.bridge.XBridgeSupplier2} interface and handles the model types {@link
    * com.sun.star.bridge.ModelDependent.UNO} and {@link com.sun.star.bridge.ModelDependent.OLE} . The service does not specify any requirements for
    * registering OLE objects and class factories.
