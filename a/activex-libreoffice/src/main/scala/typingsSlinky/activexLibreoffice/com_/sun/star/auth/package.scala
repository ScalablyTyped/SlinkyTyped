    * The Single Sign-on ( SSO ) APIs provide UNO based access to underlying SSO implementations ( e.g. Kerberos ). The aim of the SSO APIs is to enable
    * authentication ( possibly mutual ) between a client ( source or initiator ) and a network service ( target or acceptor ). This is achieved via. the
    * creation and processing of security tokens sent between the two parties. The steps which should be followed to successfully use the SSO APIs are as
    * follows: Create an {@link XSSOManagerFactory} instanceUse this factory to create/retrieve an {@link XSSOManager} instance.Depending on whether your
    * code is acting as SSO source or target, you should use the {@link XSSOManager} instance to create an initiator security context, {@link
    * XSSOInitiatorContext} or an acceptor security context, {@link XSSOAcceptorContext} respectively.On the initiator side, use the previously created
    * context to process security tokens received from the acceptor side and to create security tokens to send to the acceptor side. On the acceptor side,
    * use the previously created context to process security tokens received from the initiator side and to create security tokens to send to the initiator
    * side.
    *
    * The interface supports the creation of {@link XSSOManager} instances which can subsequently be used to create security contexts.
