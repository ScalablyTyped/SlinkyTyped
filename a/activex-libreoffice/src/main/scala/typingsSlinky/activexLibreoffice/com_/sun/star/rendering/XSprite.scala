    * transformation is set via {@link transform()} , the clip is subject to this transformation, too. The implementation is free, if it has a cached
    * representation of the sprite at hand, to clip-output only this cached representation (e.g. a bitmap), instead of re-rendering the sprite from first
    * principles. This is usually the case for an implementation of a {@link XCustomSprite} interface, since it typically has no other cached pictorial
