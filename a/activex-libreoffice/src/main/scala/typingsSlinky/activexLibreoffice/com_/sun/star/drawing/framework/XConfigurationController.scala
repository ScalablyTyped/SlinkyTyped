/**
  * The configuration controller is responsible for the management of the set of active resources.
  *
  * There are two configurations of resources: The current configuration contains the set of currently active resources.The requested configuration
  * describes what the current configuration should be. The requested configuration is changed usually by calling {@link requestResourceActivation()} and
  * {@link requestResourceDeactivation()} .
  *
  * When the two configurations differ then the current configuration is updated eventually to reflect the requested configuration. An update takes place
  * when the following three conditions are fulfilled.  1. when the last pending request for configuration changes has been processed, 2. when the {@link
  * update()} method is called. 3. when the configuration manager it is unlocked after formerly being locked.
  *
  * Requests for configuration changes are handled in a two step process:  1. First the requested configuration is updated iteratively: Every request that
  * is being made by calling {@link requestResourceActivation()} or {@link requestResourceDeactivation()} results in one or more function objects, that
  * each implement the {@link XConfigurationChangeRequest} interface. These are inserted into a queue. The request objects in the queue are processed
  * asynchronously one at a time in the order in which they are inserted. Only when one request object is processed a change to the requested
  * configuration is made. These changes are broadcasted to registered {@link XConfigurationChangeListener} objects. Listeners may decide to make requests
  * that then are added to the queue. For example when the view in the center pane is replaced by another view, some listeners may want to turn some side
  * panes on or off, or show other views in the side panes.
  *
  *
  *
  * This process goes on until the queue of request objects becomes empty. Until this point only the requested configuration has been modified. No
  * resources have been activated or deactivated.
  *
  *
  *
  *  2.
  *
  * The second update step activates or deactivates resources so that the current configuration (the one that comprises the actually active resources)
  * reflects the requested configuration.
  *
  *
  *
  * The order in which resources are activated or deactivated depends on the dependency between the resources. For example a view depends on the pane it
  * is displayed in. Resources that other resources depend on are activated first and deactivated last. The order is undefined for unrelated resources.
  *
  *
  *
  * Note that the second update step may not be able to activate (or even to deactivate) all the requested resources. Either because they are temporarily
  * or permanently unavailable. For example, during the start-up of a new Impress application the side panes are displayed with a visible delay because
  * they are not provided sooner by the underlying framework. Such unavailable resources are not forgotten but remain in the requested configuration.
  * Every time the configuration controller updates its current configuration these resources are requested once more.
  *
  * The configuration controller sends the following events: ResourceActivationRequested is sent when the activation of a resource has been requested and
  * the resource is not yet active in the requested configuration. The event is sent when the configuration change request is executed, not when the
  * {@link requestResourceActivation()} call is made.
  *
  *
  *
  * The {@link ConfigurationChangeEvent.ResourceId} member is set to the requested resource. The ResourceObject member is not set.
  *
  * ResourceDeactivationRequested is sent when the deactivation of a resource has been requested and the resource is active in the requested
  * configuration. The event is sent when the configuration change request is executed that is created when for example {@link
  * requestResourceDeactivation()} is called.
  *
  *
  *
  * The {@link ResourceId} member is set to the requested resource. The ResourceObject member is not set.
  *
  * ConfigurationUpdateStart is sent before the update of the current configuration starts.
  *
  *
  *
  * The requested configuration is available in the {@link ConfigurationChangeEvent.Configuration} member. The {@link ResourceId} and ResourceObject
  * members are not set.
  *
  * ConfigurationUpdateEnd is sent after the update of the current configuration ends.
  *
  *
  *
  * The requested configuration is available in the {@link ConfigurationChangeEvent.Configuration} member. The {@link ResourceId} and ResourceObject
  * members are not set.
  *
  * ResourceActivation is sent when a resource is activated, i.e. when a new object of a resource is created (or taken from a cache).
  *
  *
  *
  * The {@link ResourceId} and ResourceObject members are set to the {@link XResourceId} and object reference of the activated resource.
  *
  * ResourceDeactivation is sent when a resource is deactivated, i.e. when an object that previously was part of the configuration is removed from the
  * configuration.
  *
  *
  *
  * The {@link ResourceId} and ResourceObject members are set to {@link XResourceId} and object reference of the deactivated resource.
