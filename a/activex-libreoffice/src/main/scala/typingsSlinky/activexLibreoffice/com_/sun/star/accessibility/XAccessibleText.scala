/**
  * Implement this interface to give read-only access to a text.
  *
  * The {@link XAccessibleText} interface should be implemented by all UNO components that present textual information on the display like buttons, text
  * entry fields, or text portions of the document window. The interface provides access to the text's content, attributes, and spatial location. However,
  * text can not be modified with this interface. That is the task of the {@link XAccessibleEditableText} interface.
  *
  * The text length, i.e. the number of characters in the text, is returned by {@link XAccessibleText.getCharacterCount()} . All methods that operate on
  * particular characters (e.g. XAccessibleText::getCharacterAt()) use character indices from 0 to length-1. All methods that operate on character
  * positions (e.g. {@link XAccessibleText.getTextRange()} ) use indices from 0 to length.
  *
  * Please note that accessible text does not necessarily support selection. In this case it should behave as if there where no selection. An empty
  * selection is used for example to express the current cursor position.
  * @since OOo 1.1.2
