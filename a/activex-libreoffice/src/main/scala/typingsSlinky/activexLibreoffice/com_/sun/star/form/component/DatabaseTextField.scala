    * Any user interface action which needs to refer to the control is assumed to use this property. ;  A very common design method for forms is to group a
    * data aware control with a label control, with the latter describing the content of the former. For instance, you may have a {@link
    * com.sun.star.form.component.TextField} , which is bound to the e-mail column of your data source. Then you will probably add a {@link
    * com.sun.star.form.component.FixedText} whose label is "E-Mail", and associate it with the TextField by setting it as {@link LabelControl} . ;  Now if
    * you imagine a component offering data search in a form, this component will examine the {@link LabelControl} property, find the {@link
    * com.sun.star.form.component.FixedText} , examine it's label, and use this label to refer to the {@link com.sun.star.form.component.TextField} .
    *
    * When setting the property, a number of constraints apply: The object which is to be set has to support the following interfaces {@link
    * com.sun.star.awt.XControlModel}{@link com.sun.star.lang.XServiceInfo}{@link com.sun.star.beans.XPropertySet}{@link com.sun.star.container.XChild}It
    * has to be a part of the same document as the model who's property is to be modified.Additionally, the support of a special service, indicating that
    * the model is of the right type, is required. Which kind of service is in the request depends on the type of the control model. ;
    *
    * For instance, text fields ( {@link com.sun.star.form.component.TextField} ) can be labeled by label controls only ( {@link
    * com.sun.star.form.component.FixedText} ), and radio buttons ( {@link com.sun.star.form.component.RadioButton} ) can be labeled by group boxes ( {@link
    * com.sun.star.form.component.GroupBox} ) only.
