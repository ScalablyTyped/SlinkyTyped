/**
  * base interface of all UNO interfaces
  *
  * It provides lifetime control by reference counting and the possibility of querying for other interfaces of the same logical object.
  *
  * "Logical Object" in this case means that the interfaces actually can be supported by internal (e.g. aggregated) physical objects.
  *
  * Deriving from this interface is mandatory for all UNO interfaces.
  *
  * Each language binding (Java, C++, StarBasic, Python, ... ) may provide a different mapping of this interface, please look into the language dependent
  * documentation.
  *
  * The UNO object does not export the state of the reference count ( {@link acquire()} and {@link release()} do not have return values). In general, also
  * the UNO object itself should not make any assumption on the concrete value of the reference count (except on the transition from one to zero ).

  /**
    * increases the reference counter by one.
    *
    * When you have called {@link acquire()} on the UNO object, it is often said, that you have a reference or a hard reference to the object.
    *
    * It is only allowed to invoke a method on an UNO object, when you keep a hard reference to it.
    *
    * Every call to acquire must be followed by a corresponding call to release some time later, which may eventually lead to the destruction of the object.

  /**
    * queries for a new interface to an existing UNO object.
    *
    * The {@link queryInterface()} method is the entry point to obtain other interfaces which are exported by the object. The caller asks the implementation
    * of the object, if it supports the interface specified by the type argument. The call may either return with a interface reference of the requested
    * type or with a void any.
    *
    * There are certain specifications, a {@link queryInterface()} implementation must not violate.
    *
    * 1) If queryInterface on a specific object has once returned a valid interface reference for a given type, it must return a valid reference for any
    * successive queryInterface calls on this object for the same type.
    *
    * 2) If queryInterface on a specific object has once returned a null reference for a given type, it must always return a null reference for the same
    * type.
    *
    * 3) If queryInterface on a reference A returns reference B, queryInterface on B for Type A must return interface reference A or calls made on the
    * returned reference must be equivalent to calls made on reference A.
    *
    * 4) If queryInterface on a reference A returns reference B, queryInterface on A and B for {@link XInterface} must return the same interface reference
    * (object identity).
    *
    * The reason for the strong specification is, that a Uno Runtime Environment (URE) may choose to cache {@link queryInterface()} calls.
    *
    * As mentioned above, certain language bindings may map this function differently also with different specifications, please visit the language
    * dependent specification for it. The current C++ binding sticks to the specification state
    *
    * The rules mentioned above are basically identical to the rules of QueryInterface in MS COM.
    * @param aType a UNO interface type, for which an object reference shall be obtained.
    * @returns an interface reference in case the requested interface is supported by the object, a void any otherwise.
