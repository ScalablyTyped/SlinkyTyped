    * interface was mapped to `IDispatch` , then all objects (interfaces, structs) and other types which are obtained from that Automation object are
    * automatically mapped to the corresponding Automation types. Hence, if one provides an initial object which forms the root of all other objects, such
    * as a service manager, then only that object needs to be explicitly mapped by a call to {@link com.sun.star.bridge.XBridgeSupplier2.createBridge()} .
    * The same holds true if an automation object is mapped to an UNO interface.
    *
    * For Automation objects to be mapped they have to implement `IDispatch` interface. Other COM interfaces, except for `IUnknown` , are not supported. UNO
    * interfaces and structs are mapped to `IDispatch` .
