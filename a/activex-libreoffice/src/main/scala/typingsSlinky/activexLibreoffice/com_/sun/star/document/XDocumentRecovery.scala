    * When saving a session, either in case of a emergency (when OpenOffice.org crashed), or during a periodic session save as configured by the user,
    * {@link storeToRecoveryFile()} is called for every document where `wasModifiedSinceLastSave` returns `TRUE` .

    * It's allowed to implement this method sloppy, by returning `TRUE` in cases where it is not sure whether the document actually has been modified. So,
    * the most simple implementation could simply delegate this call to {@link com.sun.star.util.XModifiable.isModified()} . (Well, actually that's the
    * second simple implementation, the **most** simple one would, still legitimately, always return `TRUE` .)

    * However, in such a case, the document might be saved more often than needed. In particular during the periodic session save, this might become a
    * problem when saving is expensive, for a single document or the sum of all open documents.
