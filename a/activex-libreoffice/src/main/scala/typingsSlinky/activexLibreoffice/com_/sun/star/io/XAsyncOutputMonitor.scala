/**
  * An optional companion interface to {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream} that supports scenarios where {@link
  * com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes()} operates asynchronously and does not necessarily report any errors.
  *
  * A typical scenario where this interface is useful is when an {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream} is used to write to a file via NFS. Normally, any
  * calls to {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes()} will execute asynchronously then, in that any potential errors might only be reported by
  * later calls to {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes()} or {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.closeOutput()} . If such an output stream
  * shall not be closed immediately after one or more calls to {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes()} , but the client wants to know as soon
  * as possible whether writing was successful, then {@link com.sun.star.io.XAsyncOutputMonitor.waitForCompletion()} should be called after the series of
  * calls to {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes()} .
  * @since OOo 2.0

    *
    * Calling this method is potentially expensive (even if the associated {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream} represents a local file not accessed via
    * NFS, for example). This method has a similar description to {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.flush()} . However, where the semantics of `flush`
    * are rather vague, `waitForCompletion` has very specific semantics  --  it just blocks long enough so that any errors encountered during previous calls
    * to {@link com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes()} can reliably be reported. It specificially does not guarantee that any data have safely been
    * stored on a stable physical medium, like a hard disk (and it is completely unspecified whether `flush` should give this guarantee).
