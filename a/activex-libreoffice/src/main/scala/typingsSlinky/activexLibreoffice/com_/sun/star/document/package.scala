    * configuration data. If, however, you imagine special cases (e.g. modifying the file extension of a Writer file from .sdw to .doc), it quickly becomes
    * clear that you cannot always get a correct result with flat detection. To be certain to get correct results, you need deep detection, i.e. the file
    * itself has to be examined. And that is exactly the function of DetectServices. They get all the information collected so far on a document and then
    * decide which type to assign it to. In the new modular model, such a detector is meant as UNO service which registers itself in the office and is
    * requested by the generic type detection if necessary. ;  Therefore you need two pieces of information: The **ServiceName** - This must be a valid UNO
    * service name. It is also an entry in the corresponding configuration list. ;  Example: "com.company.devision.DetectService" ;  Note that this really
    * means the implementation name of the service. Because it's not possible otherwise to distinguish between more than one registered detect services in
    * same office installation! But it's possible for the generic type detection to create an UNO service by its implementation name too.A list of **Types**
    * able to be recognized by this service - You can also implement and register detectors for groups of types. See service {@link TypeDetection} and its
    * configuration for further information.
