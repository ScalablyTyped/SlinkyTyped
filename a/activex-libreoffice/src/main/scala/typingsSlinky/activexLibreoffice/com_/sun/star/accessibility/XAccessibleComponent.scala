/**
  * The {@link XAccessibleComponent} interface should be supported by any class that can be rendered on the screen.
  *
  * This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to retrieve information concerning the graphical representation of an
  * object. This interface combines methods from the Java interfaces `javax.accessibility.AccessibleComponent` and
  * `javax.accessibility.AccessibleExtendedComponent` .
  *
  * Further information about the graphical appearance of an object can be expressed with the {@link XAccessibleExtendedComponent} interface.
  *
  * Coordinates used by the functions of this interface are specified in different coordinate systems. Their scale is the same and is equal to that of the
  * screen coordinate system. In other words all coordinates are measured in pixel. They differ in their respective origin: The screen coordinate system
  * has its origin in the upper left corner of the current screen. Used by the {@link getLocationOnScreen()} function.The origin of the parent coordinate
  * system is the upper left corner of the parent's bounding box. With no parent the screen coordinate system is used instead. Used by the {@link
  * getLocation()} function.The object coordinate system is relative to the upper left corner of an object's bounding box. It is relative to itself so to
  * speak. Used by the {@link containsPoint()} and {@link getAccessibleAtPoint()} functions.
  *
  * Key bindings which are associated with an accessible component can be retrieved at the component's action. The reason for this is that key bindings
  * are associated with actions and directly with a component. This distinction becomes important when there are more than one action. To get access to
  * the key bindings you have to get the {@link XAccessibleAction} interface of a component, provided that it is supported, and use the
  * XAccessibleAction::getAccessibleKeyBinding().
  * @see XAccessibleExtendedComponent
  * @since OOo 1.1.2
