/**
  * defines the interface for creating bridges to other object models.
  *
  * Because bridges sometimes can not be generated in an address space, the implementation needs to check the address space of the caller by comparing the
  * machine and process ID against its own. These IDs are provided by the UNO runtime.
  *
  * All objects, whether they are part of the UNO object model or not, are carried in an `any` . The representation of this object is heavily
  * model-dependent and has to be specified in the following list:
  *
  * **UNO:  **: The any carries normal UNO types, which can be any base type, struct, sequence, enum, or interface.;
  *
  * **OLE:  **: The any carries an `unsigned long` (on 32-bit systems) or an `unsigned hyper` (on 64-bit systems), which is interpreted as a variant
  * pointer. The any does not control the lifetime of the represented variant. That implies that the caller has the responsibility of freeing the OLE
  * resources represented by the any value.;
  *
  * **JAVA:  **: not yet specified.;
  *
  * **CORBA:  **: not yet specified.
  *
  *
  *
  * Any implementation can supply its own bridges to other object models by implementing this interface and returning the bridge when the method is called
  * with itself as the first parameter.
  * @deprecated Deprecated
  * @see com.sun.star.bridge.OleBridgeSupplier
