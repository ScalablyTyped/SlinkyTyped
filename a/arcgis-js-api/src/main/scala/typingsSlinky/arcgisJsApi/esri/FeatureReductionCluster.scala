Keep in mind that this size may be smaller than the symbol size of individual non-clustered features in the layer. In that scenario, you should either reduce the size of the symbol(s) in the layer's renderer or increase the `clusterMinSize` to be larger than the size of individual points to avoid confusion for the end user. This can most likely happen when cluster size represents feature count.

When set, labels independent of the [layer.labelingInfo](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#labelingInfo) are used to convey information about the clusters, including the count of all features in the cluster, the average, or predominant values of fields mapped by the renderer.  It is advisable to turn off [label deconfliction](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-support-LabelClass.html#deconflictionStrategy) when labeling clusters with a count in the center of the cluster. To generate suggested labels for your cluster configuration based on the layer's renderer, see [clusterLabelCreator](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-smartMapping-labels-clusters.html).  The table below describes the aggregate fields used internally by the cluster renderer, which you can reference in the label expression.  Aggregate fields:
    *
    * Field Name | Type | Description
    * -----------|------|------------
    * `cluster_count` | number | The number of features in the cluster.
    * `cluster_avg_{fieldName}` | number | For renderers visualizing a number field either with size, opacity, continuous color, or class breaks, this field describes the average of the rendered field among all features in the cluster.
    * `cluster_type_{fieldName}` | string | For layers with a [UniqueValueRenderer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-renderers-UniqueValueRenderer.html), this field describes the mode, or predominant string of the rendered field among all features within the cluster.
    *
    * Multiple Label classes with different `where` clauses can be used to define several labels with varying styles on the same feature. Likewise, multiple label classes may be used to label different types of clusters (e.g. blue labels for small clusters and red labels for large ones).
