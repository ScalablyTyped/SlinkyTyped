    * @param params See the table below for details about parameters that may be passed to this function.
    * @param params.layer The layer from which to generate class breaks.
    * @param params.field The class breaks will be generated based on values of this field. If a field is provided, the values from the given field from all features will be queried in the service.
    * @param params.normalizationField The field by which to normalize the values returned from the given `field`.
    * @param params.classificationMethod
    * The method for classifying the data. See the table below for a list of possible values.
    *
    * | Possible Value | Description |
    * |---------------|------------ |
    * | natural-breaks | Data values that cluster are placed into a single class. Class breaks occur where gaps exist between clusters. You should use this method if your data is unevenly distributed; that is, many features have the same or similar values and there are gaps between groups of values. |
    * | equal-interval | Each class has an equal range of values; in other words, the difference between the high and low value is equal for each class. You should use this method if your data is evenly distributed and you want to emphasize the difference in values between the features. |
    * | quantile | Each class has roughly the same number of features. If your data is evenly distributed and you want to emphasize the difference in relative position between features, you should use the quantile classification method. If, for example, the point values are divided into five classes, points in the highest class would fall into the top fifth of all points.  |
    * | standard-deviation | Class breaks are placed above and below the mean value at intervals of `1`, `0.5`, or `0.25` standard deviations until all the data values are included in a class.  |
    * @param params.standardDeviationInterval When `classificationMethod = "standard-deviation"`, this sets the interval at which each class break should be set (e.g. `0.25`, `0.33`, `0.5`, `1`).
    * @param params.minValue The minimum bounding value for the class breaks definition. Use this in conjunction with `maxValue` to generate class breaks between lower and upper bounds.
    * @param params.maxValue The maximum bounding value for the class breaks definition. Use this in conjunction with `minValue` to generate class breaks between lower and upper bounds.
    * @param params.numClasses Indicates the number of classes to generate for the class breaks definition.
    * @param params.valueExpression An [Arcade](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/arcade/index.html) expression that returns a number. This expression can reference field values using the `$feature` global variable. This property overrides the `field` property and therefore is used instead of an input `field` value.
    * @param params.sqlExpression A SQL expression evaluating to a number.
    * @param params.sqlWhere A SQL where clause used to filter features for the statistics query. For example, this is useful in situations where you want to avoid dividing by zero as is the case with creating a predominance visualization.
    * @param params.view A [SceneView](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-SceneView.html) or [MapView](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-MapView.html) instance is required when a `valueExpression` is specified.
    * @param params.features A subset of features for which to generate the class breaks.
    * @param params.signal Allows for cancelable requests. If canceled, the promise will be rejected with an error named `AbortError`. See also [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController).
