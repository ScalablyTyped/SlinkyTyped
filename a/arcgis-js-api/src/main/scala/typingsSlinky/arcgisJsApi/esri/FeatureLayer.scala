User must provide [globalId](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#AttachmentEdit)s for all attachments to be added.
    * @param edits.updateAttachments An array of attachments to be updated. Applies only when the `options.globalIdUsed` parameter is set to `true`. User must provide [globalId](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#AttachmentEdit)s for all attachments to be updated.
    * @param edits.deleteAttachments An array of [globalId](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#AttachmentEdit)s for attachments to be deleted. Applies only when the `options.globalIdUsed` parameter is set to `true`.
    * @param options Additional edit options to specify when editing features or attachments.
    * @param options.gdbVersion The geodatabase version to apply the edits. This parameter applies only if the [capabilities.data.isVersioned](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#capabilities) property of the layer is `true`. If the gdbVersion parameter is not specified, edits are made to the published mapâ€™s version.
    * @param options.rollbackOnFailureEnabled Indicates whether the edits should be applied only if all submitted edits succeed. If `false`, the server will apply the edits that succeed even if some of the submitted edits fail. If `true`, the server will apply the edits only if all edits succeed. The layer's [capabilities.editing.supportsRollbackOnFailure](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#capabilities) property must be `true` if using this parameter. If `supportsRollbackOnFailure` is `false` for a layer, then `rollbackOnFailureEnabled` will always be true, regardless of how the parameter is set.
    * @param options.globalIdUsed Indicates whether the edits can be applied using globalIds of features or attachments. This parameter applies only if the layer's [capabilities.editing.supportsGlobalId](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#capabilities) property is `true`. When `false`, globalIds submitted with the features are ignored and the service assigns new globalIds to the new features. When `true`, the globalIds must be submitted with the new features. When updating existing features, if the `globalIdUsed` is `false`, the objectIds of the features to be updated must be provided. If the `globalIdUsed` is `true`, globalIds of features to be updated must be provided. When deleting existing features, set this property to `false` as deletes operation only accepts `objectIds` at the current version of the API.  When adding, updating or deleting attachments, `globalIdUsed` parameter must be set to `true` and the attachment globalId must be set. For new attachments, the user must provide globalIds. In order for an attachment to be updated or deleted, clients must include its globalId.  Attachments are not supported in an edit payload when `globalIdUsed` is `false`.
