/**
  * An _event_ is an object representing a change to a resource that was observed
  * by an event subscription.
  *
  * In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to higher
  * rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally, change events
  * bubble up - listening to events on a project would include when stories are
  * added to tasks in the project, even on subtasks.
  *
  * Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
  * The response will be a `412` error - the same as if the sync token had
  * expired.
  *
  * Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the immediately
  * preceding call.
  *
  * Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go 'backward' in the history
  * by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current sync token
  * is generally safe, and will always return the same results.
  *
  * When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the
  * sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a set
  * of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.
  *
  * Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner, depending on
  * load on the service.
