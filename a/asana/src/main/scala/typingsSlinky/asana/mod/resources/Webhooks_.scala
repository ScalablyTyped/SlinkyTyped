/**
  * **Webhooks are currently in BETA - The information here may change.**
  *
  * Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes. This is in addition
  * to the ability to fetch those changes directly as
  * [Events](/developers/api-reference/events) - in fact, Webhooks are just a way
  * to receive Events via HTTP POST at the time they occur instead of polling for
  * them. For services accessible via HTTP this is often vastly more convenient,
  * and if events are not too frequent can be significantly more efficient.
  *
  * In both cases, however, changes are represented as Event objects - refer to
  * the [Events documentation](/developers/api-reference/events) for more
  * information on what data these events contain.
  *
  * **NOTE:** While Webhooks send arrays of Event objects to their target, the
  * Event objects themselves contain *only IDs*, rather than the actual resource
  * they are referencing. So while a normal event you receive via GET /events
  * would look like this:
  *
  *     {\
  *       "resource": {\
  *         "id": 1337,\
  *         "name": "My Task"\
  *       },\
  *       "parent": null,\
  *       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
  *       "user": {\
  *         "id": 1123,\
  *         "name": "Tom Bizarro"\
  *       },\
  *       "action": "changed",\
  *       "type": "task"\
  *     }
  *
  * In a Webhook payload you would instead receive this:
  *
  *     {\
  *       "resource": 1337,\
  *       "parent": null,\
  *       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
  *       "user": 1123,\
  *       "action": "changed",\
  *       "type": "task"\
  *     }
  *
  * Webhooks themselves contain only the information necessary to deliver the
  * events to the desired target as they are generated.
  * @class
  * @param {Dispatcher} dispatcher The API dispatcher

  /**
    * * Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
    * * similar to any other resource creation. Since you could have multiple
    * * webhooks we recommend specifying a unique local id for each target.
    * *
    * * Next comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will
    * * send a test POST to the `target` with an `X-Hook-Secret` header as
    * * described in the
    * * [Resthooks Security documentation](http://resthooks.org/docs/security/).
    * * The target must respond with a `200 OK` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret`
    * * header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected.
    * *
    * * If you do not acknowledge the webhook's confirmation handshake it will
    * * fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt
    * * to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the
    * * webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight.
