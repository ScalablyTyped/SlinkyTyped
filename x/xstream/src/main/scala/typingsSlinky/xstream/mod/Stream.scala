  /**
    * *imitate* changes this current Stream to emit the same events that the
    * `other` given Stream does. This method returns nothing.
    *
    * This method exists to allow one thing: **circular dependency of streams**.
    * For instance, let's imagine that for some reason you need to create a
    * circular dependency where stream `first$` depends on stream `second$`
    * which in turn depends on `first$`:
    *
    * <!-- skip-example -->
    * ```js
    * import delay from 'xstream/extra/delay'
    *
    * var first$ = second$.map(x => x * 10).take(3);
    * var second$ = first$.map(x => x + 1).startWith(1).compose(delay(100));
    * ```
    *
    * However, that is invalid JavaScript, because `second$` is undefined
    * on the first line. This is how *imitate* can help solve it:
    *
    * ```js
    * import delay from 'xstream/extra/delay'
    *
    * var secondProxy$ = xs.create();
    * var first$ = secondProxy$.map(x => x * 10).take(3);
    * var second$ = first$.map(x => x + 1).startWith(1).compose(delay(100));
    * secondProxy$.imitate(second$);
    * ```
    *
    * We create `secondProxy$` before the others, so it can be used in the
    * declaration of `first$`. Then, after both `first$` and `second$` are
    * defined, we hook `secondProxy$` with `second$` with `imitate()` to tell
    * that they are "the same". `imitate` will not trigger the start of any
    * stream, it just binds `secondProxy$` and `second$` together.
    *
    * The following is an example where `imitate()` is important in Cycle.js
    * applications. A parent component contains some child components. A child
    * has an action stream which is given to the parent to define its state:
    *
    * <!-- skip-example -->
    * ```js
    * const childActionProxy$ = xs.create();
    * const parent = Parent({...sources, childAction$: childActionProxy$});
    * const childAction$ = parent.state$.map(s => s.child.action$).flatten();
    * childActionProxy$.imitate(childAction$);
    * ```
    *
    * Note, though, that **`imitate()` does not support MemoryStreams**. If we
    * would attempt to imitate a MemoryStream in a circular dependency, we would
    * either get a race condition (where the symptom would be "nothing happens")
    * or an infinite cyclic emission of values. It's useful to think about
    * MemoryStreams as cells in a spreadsheet. It doesn't make any sense to
    * define a spreadsheet cell `A1` with a formula that depends on `B1` and
    * cell `B1` defined with a formula that depends on `A1`.
    *
    * If you find yourself wanting to use `imitate()` with a
    * MemoryStream, you should rework your code around `imitate()` to use a
    * Stream instead. Look for the stream in the circular dependency that
    * represents an event stream, and that would be a candidate for creating a
    * proxy Stream which then imitates the target Stream.
    *
    * @param {Stream} target The other stream to imitate on the current one. Must
    * not be a MemoryStream.
