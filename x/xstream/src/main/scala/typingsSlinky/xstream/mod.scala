      * *imitate* changes this current Stream to emit the same events that the
      * `other` given Stream does. This method returns nothing.
      *
      * This method exists to allow one thing: **circular dependency of streams**.
      * For instance, let's imagine that for some reason you need to create a
      * circular dependency where stream `first$` depends on stream `second$`
      * which in turn depends on `first$`:
      *
      * <!-- skip-example -->
      * ```js
      * import delay from 'xstream/extra/delay'
      *
      * var first$ = second$.map(x => x * 10).take(3);
      * var second$ = first$.map(x => x + 1).startWith(1).compose(delay(100));
      * ```
      *
      * However, that is invalid JavaScript, because `second$` is undefined
      * on the first line. This is how *imitate* can help solve it:
      *
      * ```js
      * import delay from 'xstream/extra/delay'
      *
      * var secondProxy$ = xs.create();
      * var first$ = secondProxy$.map(x => x * 10).take(3);
      * var second$ = first$.map(x => x + 1).startWith(1).compose(delay(100));
      * secondProxy$.imitate(second$);
      * ```
      *
      * We create `secondProxy$` before the others, so it can be used in the
      * declaration of `first$`. Then, after both `first$` and `second$` are
      * defined, we hook `secondProxy$` with `second$` with `imitate()` to tell
      * that they are "the same". `imitate` will not trigger the start of any
      * stream, it just binds `secondProxy$` and `second$` together.
      *
      * The following is an example where `imitate()` is important in Cycle.js
      * applications. A parent component contains some child components. A child
      * has an action stream which is given to the parent to define its state:
      *
      * <!-- skip-example -->
      * ```js
      * const childActionProxy$ = xs.create();
      * const parent = Parent({...sources, childAction$: childActionProxy$});
      * const childAction$ = parent.state$.map(s => s.child.action$).flatten();
      * childActionProxy$.imitate(childAction$);
      * ```
      *
      * Note, though, that **`imitate()` does not support MemoryStreams**. If we
      * would attempt to imitate a MemoryStream in a circular dependency, we would
      * either get a race condition (where the symptom would be "nothing happens")
      * or an infinite cyclic emission of values. It's useful to think about
      * MemoryStreams as cells in a spreadsheet. It doesn't make any sense to
      * define a spreadsheet cell `A1` with a formula that depends on `B1` and
      * cell `B1` defined with a formula that depends on `A1`.
      *
      * If you find yourself wanting to use `imitate()` with a
      * MemoryStream, you should rework your code around `imitate()` to use a
      * Stream instead. Look for the stream in the circular dependency that
      * represents an event stream, and that would be a candidate for creating a
      * proxy Stream which then imitates the target Stream.
      *
      * @param {Stream} target The other stream to imitate on the current one. Must
      * not be a MemoryStream.
