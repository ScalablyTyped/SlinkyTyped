    * After a lot of thought I've decided that entities shouldn't be resolved in the Lexer,

    * Instead entities are just ignored and are stored as-is as part of the node because:
    * (1) We only support entities that resolve to characters, we don't support crufty
    *     complicated entities that insert elements, so there's no actual structural need to
    *     do it.
    * (2) It simplifies the code and data structures, and it shrinks data structure memory usage.
    *     E.g. Text doesn't need to switch between TEXT_NODE and ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE.
    * (3) They can be resolved later using a utility function. E.g. have a .textContent() on
    *     nodes that resolves it. This approach would probably result in less memory use.
    * (4) It's slightly against style of zero-copy because we'd need to make new strings
    *     to resolve the entities. Not a difficult job but again it's unnecessary memory use.
    *
    * So I've decided that's not the job of this lexer.
