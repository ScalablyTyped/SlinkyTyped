    * The third argument specifies whether the range is open or closed. An open range does not include the upper and lower bounds while a closed range includes them. If not specified (or set to false), the range is closed. If set to true the range is open.

You can use this to plot a histogram of your data, or to compare it to commonly known distribution functions.

    * This value suggests that we are 95% certain that the real mean of the population is within 2.60 of the calculated arithmetic mean of 4.67. We could use this to find out the percent error in our sample. In this case there is a 55.71% error.
    * The margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of data points, so increasing the size of your sample will reduce the margin of error. It is good to strive for a margin of error of less than 5%.

    * Passing in 50 as an argument will return the median, while 25 and 75 will return the first and third quartiles respectively. These three special values may be arithmetic means of two other values within the set. All other arguments will return a number from the data set.
