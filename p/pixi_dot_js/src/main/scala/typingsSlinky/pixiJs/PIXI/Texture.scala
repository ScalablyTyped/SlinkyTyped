/**
  * A texture stores the information that represents an image or part of an image.
  *
  * It cannot be added to the display list directly; instead use it as the texture for a Sprite.
  * If no frame is provided for a texture, then the whole image is used.
  *
  * You can directly create a texture from an image and then reuse it multiple times like this :
  *
  * ```js
  * let texture = PIXI.Texture.from('assets/image.png');
  * let sprite1 = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);
  * let sprite2 = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);
  * ```
  *
  * If you didnt pass the texture frame to constructor, it enables `noFrame` mode:
  * it subscribes on baseTexture events, it automatically resizes at the same time as baseTexture.
  *
  * Textures made from SVGs, loaded or not, cannot be used before the file finishes processing.
  * You can check for this by checking the sprite's _textureID property.
  * ```js
  * var texture = PIXI.Texture.from('assets/image.svg');
  * var sprite1 = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);
  * //sprite1._textureID should not be undefined if the texture has finished processing the SVG file
  * ```
  * You can use a ticker or rAF to ensure your sprites load the finished textures after processing. See issue #3068.
