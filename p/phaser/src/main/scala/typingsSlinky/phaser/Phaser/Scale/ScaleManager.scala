/**
  * The Scale Manager handles the scaling, resizing and alignment of the game canvas.
  * 
  * The way scaling is handled is by setting the game canvas to a fixed size, which is defined in the
  * game configuration. You also define the parent container in the game config. If no parent is given,
  * it will default to using the document body. The Scale Manager will then look at the available space
  * within the _parent_ and scale the canvas accordingly. Scaling is handled by setting the canvas CSS
  * width and height properties, leaving the width and height of the canvas element itself untouched.
  * Scaling is therefore achieved by keeping the core canvas the same size and 'stretching'
  * it via its CSS properties. This gives the same result and speed as using the `transform-scale` CSS
  * property, without the need for browser prefix handling.
  * 
  * The calculations for the scale are heavily influenced by the bounding parent size, which is the computed
  * dimensions of the canvas's parent. The CSS rules of the parent element play an important role in the
  * operation of the Scale Manager. For example, if the parent has no defined width or height, then actions
  * like auto-centering will fail to achieve the required result. The Scale Manager works in tandem with the
  * CSS you set-up on the page hosting your game, rather than taking control of it.
  * 
  * #### Parent and Display canvas containment guidelines:
  * 
  * - Style the Parent element (of the game canvas) to control the Parent size and thus the games size and layout.
  * 
  * - The Parent element's CSS styles should _effectively_ apply maximum (and minimum) bounding behavior.
  * 
  * - The Parent element should _not_ apply a padding as this is not accounted for.
  *   If a padding is required apply it to the Parent's parent or apply a margin to the Parent.
  *   If you need to add a border, margin or any other CSS around your game container, then use a parent element and
  *   apply the CSS to this instead, otherwise you'll be constantly resizing the shape of the game container.
  * 
  * - The Display canvas layout CSS styles (i.e. margins, size) should not be altered / specified as
  *   they may be updated by the Scale Manager.
  * 
  * #### Scale Modes
  * 
  * The way the scaling is handled is determined by the `scaleMode` property. The default is `NONE`,
  * which prevents Phaser from scaling or touching the canvas, or its parent, at all. In this mode, you are
  * responsible for all scaling. The other scaling modes afford you automatic scaling.
  * 
  * If you wish to scale your game so that it always fits into the available space within the parent, you
  * should use the scale mode `FIT`. Look at the documentation for other scale modes to see what options are
  * available. Here is a basic config showing how to set this scale mode:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * scale: {
  *     parent: 'yourgamediv',
  *     mode: Phaser.Scale.FIT,
  *     width: 800,
  *     height: 600
  * }
  * ```
  * 
  * Place the `scale` config object within your game config.
  * 
  * If you wish for the canvas to be resized directly, so that the canvas itself fills the available space
  * (i.e. it isn't scaled, it's resized) then use the `RESIZE` scale mode. This will give you a 1:1 mapping
  * of canvas pixels to game size. In this mode CSS isn't used to scale the canvas, it's literally adjusted
  * to fill all available space within the parent. You should be extremely careful about the size of the
  * canvas you're creating when doing this, as the larger the area, the more work the GPU has to do and it's
  * very easy to hit fill-rate limits quickly.
  * 
  * For complex, custom-scaling requirements, you should probably consider using the `RESIZE` scale mode,
  * with your own limitations in place re: canvas dimensions and managing the scaling with the game scenes
  * yourself. For the vast majority of games, however, the `FIT` mode is likely to be the most used.
  * 
  * Please appreciate that the Scale Manager cannot perform miracles. All it does is scale your game canvas
  * as best it can, based on what it can infer from its surrounding area. There are all kinds of environments
  * where it's up to you to guide and help the canvas position itself, especially when built into rendering
  * frameworks like React and Vue. If your page requires meta tags to prevent user scaling gestures, or such
  * like, then it's up to you to ensure they are present in the html.
  * 
  * #### Centering
  * 
  * You can also have the game canvas automatically centered. Again, this relies heavily on the parent being
  * properly configured and styled, as the centering offsets are based entirely on the available space
  * within the parent element. Centering is disabled by default, or can be applied horizontally, vertically,
  * or both. Here's an example:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * scale: {
  *     parent: 'yourgamediv',
  *     autoCenter: Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH,
  *     width: 800,
  *     height: 600
  * }
  * ```
  * 
  * #### Fullscreen API
  * 
  * If the browser supports it, you can send your game into fullscreen mode. In this mode, the game will fill
  * the entire display, removing all browser UI and anything else present on the screen. It will remain in this
  * mode until your game either disables it, or until the user tabs out or presses ESCape if on desktop. It's a
  * great way to achieve a desktop-game like experience from the browser, but it does require a modern browser
  * to handle it. Some mobile browsers also support this.
