/**
  * The Polygon Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
  * 
  * The Polygon Shape is created by providing a list of points, which are then used to create an
  * internal Polygon geometry object. The points can be set from a variety of formats:
  * 
  * - A string containing paired values separated by a single space: `'40 0 40 20 100 20 100 80 40 80 40 100 0 50'`
  * - An array of Point or Vector2 objects: `[new Phaser.Math.Vector2(x1, y1), ...]`
  * - An array of objects with public x/y properties: `[obj1, obj2, ...]`
  * - An array of paired numbers that represent point coordinates: `[x1,y1, x2,y2, ...]`
  * - An array of arrays with two elements representing x/y coordinates: `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]`
  * 
  * By default the `x` and `y` coordinates of this Shape refer to the center of it. However, depending
  * on the coordinates of the points provided, the final shape may be rendered offset from its origin.
