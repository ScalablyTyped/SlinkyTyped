/**
  * The PluginManager is responsible for installing and adding plugins to Phaser.
  * 
  * It is a global system and therefore belongs to the Game instance, not a specific Scene.
  * 
  * It works in conjunction with the PluginCache. Core internal plugins automatically register themselves 
  * with the Cache, but it's the Plugin Manager that is responsible for injecting them into the Scenes.
  * 
  * There are two types of plugin:
  * 
  * 1. A Global Plugin
  * 2. A Scene Plugin
  * 
  * A Global Plugin is a plugin that lives within the Plugin Manager rather than a Scene. You can get
  * access to it by calling `PluginManager.get` and providing a key. Any Scene that requests a plugin in
  * this way will all get access to the same plugin instance, allowing you to use a single plugin across
  * multiple Scenes.
  * 
  * A Scene Plugin is a plugin dedicated to running within a Scene. These are different to Global Plugins
  * in that their instances do not live within the Plugin Manager, but within the Scene Systems class instead.
  * And that every Scene created is given its own unique instance of a Scene Plugin. Examples of core Scene
  * Plugins include the Input Plugin, the Tween Plugin and the physics Plugins.
  * 
  * You can add a plugin to Phaser in three different ways:
  * 
  * 1. Preload it
  * 2. Include it in your source code and install it via the Game Config
  * 3. Include it in your source code and install it within a Scene
  * 
  * For examples of all of these approaches please see the Phaser 3 Examples Repo `plugins` folder.
  * 
  * For information on creating your own plugin please see the Phaser 3 Plugin Template.
