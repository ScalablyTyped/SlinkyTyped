/**
  * The Keyboard Plugin is an input plugin that belongs to the Scene-owned Input system.
  * 
  * Its role is to listen for native DOM Keyboard Events and then process them.
  * 
  * You do not need to create this class directly, the Input system will create an instance of it automatically.
  * 
  * You can access it from within a Scene using `this.input.keyboard`. For example, you can do:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * this.input.keyboard.on('keydown', callback, context);
  * ```
  * 
  * Or, to listen for a specific key:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * this.input.keyboard.on('keydown-A', callback, context);
  * ```
  * 
  * You can also create Key objects, which you can then poll in your game loop:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * var spaceBar = this.input.keyboard.addKey(Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyCodes.SPACE);
  * ```
  * 
  * If you have multiple parallel Scenes, each trying to get keyboard input, be sure to disable capture on them to stop them from
  * stealing input from another Scene in the list. You can do this with `this.input.keyboard.enabled = false` within the
  * Scene to stop all input, or `this.input.keyboard.preventDefault = false` to stop a Scene halting input on another Scene.
  * 
  * _Note_: Many keyboards are unable to process certain combinations of keys due to hardware limitations known as ghosting.
  * See http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/4876-impossible-to-use-more-than-2-keyboard-input-buttons-at-the-same-time/ for more details.
  * 
  * Also please be aware that certain browser extensions can disable or override Phaser keyboard handling.
  * For example the Chrome extension vimium is known to disable Phaser from using the D key, while EverNote disables the backtick key.
  * And there are others. So, please check your extensions before opening Phaser issues about keys that don't work.

  /**
    * By default when a key is pressed Phaser will not stop the event from propagating up to the browser.
    * There are some keys this can be annoying for, like the arrow keys or space bar, which make the browser window scroll.
    * 
    * This `addCapture` method enables consuming keyboard events for specific keys, so they don't bubble up the browser
    * and cause the default behaviors.
    * 
    * Please note that keyboard captures are global. This means that if you call this method from within a Scene, to say prevent
    * the SPACE BAR from triggering a page scroll, then it will prevent it for any Scene in your game, not just the calling one.

    * this.input.keyboard.addCapture(62);

    * ```javascript
    * this.input.keyboard.addCapture('W,S,A,D');
