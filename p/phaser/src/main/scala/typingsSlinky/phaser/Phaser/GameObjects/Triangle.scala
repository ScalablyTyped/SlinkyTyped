/**
  * The Triangle Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
  * 
  * The Triangle consists of 3 lines, joining up to form a triangular shape. You can control the
  * position of each point of these lines. The triangle is always closed and cannot have an open
  * face. If you require that, consider using a Polygon instead.
