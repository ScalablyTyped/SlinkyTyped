      * 'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads
      * already connected.
      * 
      * Once you have received the connected event, or polled the gamepads and found them enabled, you can access
      * them via the built-in properties `GamepadPlugin.pad1` to `pad4`, for up to 4 game pads. With a reference
      * to the gamepads you can poll its buttons and axis sticks. See the properties and methods available on
