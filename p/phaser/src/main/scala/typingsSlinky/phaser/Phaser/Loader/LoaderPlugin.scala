/**
  * The Loader handles loading all external content such as Images, Sounds, Texture Atlases and data files.
  * You typically interact with it via `this.load` in your Scene. Scenes can have a `preload` method, which is always
  * called before the Scenes `create` method, allowing you to preload assets that the Scene may need.
  * 
  * If you call any `this.load` methods from outside of `Scene.preload` then you need to start the Loader going
  * yourself by calling `Loader.start()`. It's only automatically started during the Scene preload.
  * 
  * The Loader uses a combination of tag loading (eg. Audio elements) and XHR and provides progress and completion events.
  * Files are loaded in parallel by default. The amount of concurrent connections can be controlled in your Game Configuration.
  * 
  * Once the Loader has started loading you are still able to add files to it. These can be injected as a result of a loader
  * event, the type of file being loaded (such as a pack file) or other external events. As long as the Loader hasn't finished
  * simply adding a new file to it, while running, will ensure it's added into the current queue.
  * 
  * Every Scene has its own instance of the Loader and they are bound to the Scene in which they are created. However,
  * assets loaded by the Loader are placed into global game-level caches. For example, loading an XML file will place that
  * file inside `Game.cache.xml`, which is accessible from every Scene in your game, no matter who was responsible
  * for loading it. The same is true of Textures. A texture loaded in one Scene is instantly available to all other Scenes
  * in your game.
  * 
  * The Loader works by using custom File Types. These are stored in the FileTypesManager, which injects them into the Loader
  * when it's instantiated. You can create your own custom file types by extending either the File or MultiFile classes.
  * See those files for more details.

  /**
    * Adds an Animation JSON Data file, or array of Animation JSON files, to the current load queue.
    * 
    * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.animation('baddieAnims', 'files/BaddieAnims.json');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
    * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
    * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
    * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global JSON Cache upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the JSON Cache.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the JSON Cache first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.animation({
    *     key: 'baddieAnims',
    *     url: 'files/BaddieAnims.json'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.JSONFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the file has finished loading it will automatically be passed to the global Animation Managers `fromJSON` method.
    * This will parse all of the JSON data and create animation data from it. This process happens at the very end
    * of the Loader, once every other file in the load queue has finished. The reason for this is to allow you to load
    * both animation data and the images it relies upon in the same load call.
    * 
    * Once the animation data has been parsed you will be able to play animations using that data.
    * Please see the Animation Manager `fromJSON` method for more details about the format and playback.
    * 
    * You can also access the raw animation data from its Cache using its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.animation('baddieAnims', 'files/BaddieAnims.json');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * var data = this.cache.json.get('baddieAnims');
    * ```
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `LEVEL1.` and the key was `Waves` the final key will be `LEVEL1.Waves` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the text from the JSON Cache.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "data"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "data.json". It will always add `.json` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * You can also optionally provide a `dataKey` to use. This allows you to extract only a part of the JSON and store it in the Cache,
    * rather than the whole file. For example, if your JSON data had a structure like this:
    * 
    * ```json
    * {
    *     "level1": {
    *         "baddies": {
    *             "aliens": {},
    *             "boss": {}
    *         }
    *     },
    *     "level2": {},
    *     "level3": {}
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * And if you only wanted to create animations from the `boss` data, then you could pass `level1.baddies.boss`as the `dataKey`.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the JSON File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.json`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.json".
    * @param dataKey When the Animation JSON file loads only this property will be stored in the Cache and used to create animation data.
    * @param xhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

    * 
    * Phaser expects the atlas data to be provided in a JSON file, using either the JSON Hash or JSON Array format.
    * These files are created by software such as Texture Packer, Shoebox and Adobe Flash / Animate.
    * If you are using Texture Packer and have enabled multi-atlas support, then please use the Phaser Multi Atlas loader
    * instead of this one.
    * 
    * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.

    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.AtlasJSONFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Instead of passing a URL for the atlas JSON data you can also pass in a well formed JSON object instead.
    * 
    * Once the atlas has finished loading you can use frames from it as textures for a Game Object by referencing its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.atlas('mainmenu', 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu.json');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * this.add.image(x, y, 'mainmenu', 'background');
    * ```
    * 
    * To get a list of all available frames within an atlas please consult your Texture Atlas software.
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and

    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
    * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.atlas('mainmenu', [ 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu-n.png' ], 'images/MainMenu.json');

    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.

    * 
    * Audio Sprites are a combination of audio files and a JSON configuration.
    * The JSON follows the format of that created by https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite
    * 
    * If the JSON file includes a 'resource' object then you can let Phaser parse it and load the audio
    * files automatically based on its content. To do this exclude the audio URLs from the load:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.audioSprite('kyobi', 'kyobi.json');

    * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
    * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Audio Cache upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Audio Cache.

    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
    * this is what you would use when creating a Bitmap Text object.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
    * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.bitmapFont('goldenFont', [ 'images/GoldFont.png', 'images/GoldFont-n.png' ], 'images/GoldFont.xml');
    * ```
    * 
    * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.bitmapFont({
    *     key: 'goldenFont',
    *     textureURL: 'images/GoldFont.png',
    *     normalMap: 'images/GoldFont-n.png',
    *     fontDataURL: 'images/GoldFont.xml'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.
    * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Bitmap Font File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param textureURL The absolute or relative URL to load the font image file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.png`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.png".
    * @param fontDataURL The absolute or relative URL to load the font xml data file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.xml`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.xml".
    * @param textureXhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object for the font image file. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.
    * @param fontDataXhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object for the font data xml file. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

  /**
    * Adds an Image, or array of Images, to the current load queue.
    * 
    * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.image('logo', 'images/phaserLogo.png');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
    * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
    * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.
    * If you try to load an animated gif only the first frame will be rendered. Browsers do not natively support playback
    * of animated gifs to Canvas elements.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.image({
    *     key: 'logo',
    *     url: 'images/AtariLogo.png'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.ImageFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the file has finished loading you can use it as a texture for a Game Object by referencing its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.image('logo', 'images/AtariLogo.png');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * this.add.image(x, y, 'logo');
    * ```
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
    * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.image('logo', [ 'images/AtariLogo.png', 'images/AtariLogo-n.png' ]);
    * ```
    * 
    * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.image({
    *     key: 'logo',
    *     url: 'images/AtariLogo.png',
    *     normalMap: 'images/AtariLogo-n.png'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.
    * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Image File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.png`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.png".
    * @param xhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

  /**
    * Adds a Multi Texture Atlas, or array of multi atlases, to the current load queue.
    * 
    * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.multiatlas('level1', 'images/Level1.json');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
    * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
    * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
    * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
    * 
    * Phaser expects the atlas data to be provided in a JSON file as exported from the application Texture Packer,
    * version 4.6.3 or above, where you have made sure to use the Phaser 3 Export option.
    * 
    * The way it works internally is that you provide a URL to the JSON file. Phaser then loads this JSON, parses it and
    * extracts which texture files it also needs to load to complete the process. If the JSON also defines normal maps,
    * Phaser will load those as well.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.multiatlas({
    *     key: 'level1',
    *     atlasURL: 'images/Level1.json'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.MultiAtlasFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Instead of passing a URL for the atlas JSON data you can also pass in a well formed JSON object instead.
    * 
    * Once the atlas has finished loading you can use frames from it as textures for a Game Object by referencing its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.multiatlas('level1', 'images/Level1.json');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * this.add.image(x, y, 'level1', 'background');
    * ```
    * 
    * To get a list of all available frames within an atlas please consult your Texture Atlas software.
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Multi Atlas File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param atlasURL The absolute or relative URL to load the texture atlas json data file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.json`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.json".
    * @param path Optional path to use when loading the textures defined in the atlas data.
    * @param baseURL Optional Base URL to use when loading the textures defined in the atlas data.
    * @param atlasXhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object for the atlas json file. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

  /**
    * Adds a JSON File Pack, or array of packs, to the current load queue.
    * 
    * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.pack('level1', 'data/Level1Files.json');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * A File Pack is a JSON file (or object) that contains details about other files that should be added into the Loader.
    * Here is a small example:
    * 
    * ```json
    * {
    *    "test1": {
    *        "files": [
    *            {
    *                "type": "image",
    *                "key": "taikodrummaster",
    *                "url": "assets/pics/taikodrummaster.jpg"
    *            },
    *            {
    *                "type": "image",
    *                "key": "sukasuka-chtholly",
    *                "url": "assets/pics/sukasuka-chtholly.png"
    *            }
    *        ]
    *    },

    *        "copyright": "Photon Storm Ltd. 2018"
    *    }
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The pack can be split into sections. In the example above you'll see a section called `test1. You can tell
    * the `load.pack` method to parse only a particular section of a pack. The pack is stored in the JSON Cache,
    * so you can pass it to the Loader to process additional sections as needed in your game, or you can just load
    * them all at once without specifying anything.
    * 
    * The pack file can contain an entry for any type of file that Phaser can load. The object structures exactly
    * match that of the file type configs, and all properties available within the file type configs can be used
    * in the pack file too.
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,

    * });
    * ```

    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "data"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "data.json". It will always add `.json` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * You can also optionally provide a `dataKey` to use. This allows you to extract only a part of the JSON and store it in the Cache,
    * rather than the whole file. For example, if your JSON data had a structure like this:
    * 
    * ```json
    * {
    *     "level1": {
    *         "baddies": {
    *             "aliens": {},
    *             "boss": {}
    *         }
    *     },
    *     "level2": {},
    *     "level3": {}
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * And you only wanted to store the `boss` data in the Cache, then you could pass `level1.baddies.boss`as the `dataKey`.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Pack File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.json`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.json".
    * @param dataKey When the JSON file loads only this property will be stored in the Cache.

    *     this.load.plugin('modplayer', 'plugins/ModPlayer.js');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
    * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
    * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String and not already in-use by another file in the Loader.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.plugin({
    *     key: 'modplayer',
    *     url: 'plugins/ModPlayer.js'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.PluginFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the file has finished loading it will automatically be converted into a script element
    * via `document.createElement('script')`. It will have its language set to JavaScript, `defer` set to
    * false and then the resulting element will be appended to `document.head`. Any code then in the
    * script will be executed. It will then be passed to the Phaser PluginCache.register method.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.js". It will always add `.js` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Plugin File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.js`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.js". Or, a plugin function.
    * @param start Automatically start the plugin after loading?
    * @param mapping If this plugin is to be injected into the Scene, this is the property key used.

    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.sceneFile('Level1', 'src/Level1.js');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued

    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Scene Manager upon a successful load.
    * 
    * For a Scene File it's vitally important that the key matches the class name in the JavaScript file.
    * 
    * For example here is the source file:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * class ExternalScene extends Phaser.Scene {
    * 
    *     constructor ()
    *     {
    *         super('myScene');
    *     }
    * 
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * Because the class is called `ExternalScene` that is the exact same key you must use when loading it:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.sceneFile('ExternalScene', 'src/yourScene.js');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The key that is used within the Scene Manager can either be set to the same, or you can override it in the Scene
    * constructor, as we've done in the example above, where the Scene key was changed to `myScene`.
    * 
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and Scenes already present in the Scene Manager.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the Scene Manager first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.sceneFile({
    *     key: 'Level1',
    *     url: 'src/Level1.js'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.SceneFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the file has finished loading it will be added to the Scene Manager.
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.sceneFile('Level1', 'src/Level1.js');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * this.scene.start('Level1');
    * ```
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `WORLD1.` and the key was `Story` the final key will be `WORLD1.Story` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the text from the Scene Manager.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "story"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "story.js". It will always add `.js` as the extension, although

    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Scene File type has been built into Phaser.

  /**
    * Adds a Sprite Sheet Image, or array of Sprite Sheet Images, to the current load queue.
    * 
    * The term 'Sprite Sheet' in Phaser means a fixed-size sheet. Where every frame in the sheet is the exact same size,
    * and you reference those frames using numbers, not frame names. This is not the same thing as a Texture Atlas, where
    * the frames are packed in a way where they take up the least amount of space, and are referenced by their names,
    * not numbers. Some articles and software use the term 'Sprite Sheet' to mean Texture Atlas, so please be aware of
    * what sort of file you're actually trying to load.
    * 
    * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.spritesheet('bot', 'images/robot.png', { frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 38 });
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
    * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
    * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.
    * If you try to load an animated gif only the first frame will be rendered. Browsers do not natively support playback
    * of animated gifs to Canvas elements.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.spritesheet({
    *     key: 'bot',
    *     url: 'images/robot.png',
    *     frameConfig: {
    *         frameWidth: 32,
    *         frameHeight: 38,
    *         startFrame: 0,
    *         endFrame: 8
    *     }
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.SpriteSheetFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the file has finished loading you can use it as a texture for a Game Object by referencing its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.spritesheet('bot', 'images/robot.png', { frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 38 });
    * // and later in your game ...
    * this.add.image(x, y, 'bot', 0);
    * ```
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `PLAYER.` and the key was `Running` the final key will be `PLAYER.Running` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
    * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.spritesheet('logo', [ 'images/AtariLogo.png', 'images/AtariLogo-n.png' ], { frameWidth: 256, frameHeight: 80 });
    * ```
    * 
    * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.spritesheet({
    *     key: 'logo',
    *     url: 'images/AtariLogo.png',
    *     normalMap: 'images/AtariLogo-n.png',
    *     frameConfig: {
    *         frameWidth: 256,
    *         frameHeight: 80
    *     }
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.
    * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Sprite Sheet File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.png`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.png".
    * @param frameConfig The frame configuration object. At a minimum it should have a `frameWidth` property.
    * @param xhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

    * Adds an SVG File, or array of SVG Files, to the current load queue. When the files are loaded they

    * 
    * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg');
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
    * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
    * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.svg({
    *     key: 'morty',
    *     url: 'images/Morty.svg'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.SVGFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the file has finished loading you can use it as a texture for a Game Object by referencing its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * this.add.image(x, y, 'morty');
    * ```
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.html". It will always add `.html` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * You can optionally pass an SVG Resize Configuration object when you load an SVG file. By default the SVG will be rendered to a texture
    * at the same size defined in the SVG file attributes. However, this isn't always desirable. You may wish to resize the SVG (either down
    * or up) to improve texture clarity, or reduce texture memory consumption. You can either specify an exact width and height to resize
    * the SVG to:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg', { width: 300, height: 600 });
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * Or when using a configuration object:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.svg({
    *     key: 'morty',
    *     url: 'images/Morty.svg',
    *     svgConfig: {
    *         width: 300,
    *         height: 600
    *     }
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * Alternatively, you can just provide a scale factor instead:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * function preload ()
    * {
    *     this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg', { scale: 2.5 });
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * Or when using a configuration object:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.svg({
    *     key: 'morty',
    *     url: 'images/Morty.svg',
    *     svgConfig: {
    *         scale: 2.5
    *     }
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * If scale, width and height values are all given, the scale has priority and the width and height values are ignored.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the SVG File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.svg`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.svg".
    * @param svgConfig The svg size configuration object.
    * @param xhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

    * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
    * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
    * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
    * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
    * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Tilemap Cache upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Tilemap Cache.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the Text Cache first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.tilemapTiledJSON({
    *     key: 'level1',
    *     url: 'maps/Level1.json'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.TilemapJSONFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the file has finished loading you can access it from its Cache using its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.tilemapTiledJSON('level1', 'maps/Level1.json');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * var map = this.make.tilemap({ key: 'level1' });
    * ```
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `LEVEL1.` and the key was `Story` the final key will be `LEVEL1.Story` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the text from the Tilemap Cache.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "level"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "level.json". It will always add `.json` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Tilemap JSON File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.json`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.json". Or, a well formed JSON object.
    * @param xhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

    * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
    * loaded.
    * 
    * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
    * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
    * 
    * Phaser expects the atlas data to be provided in a YAML formatted text file as exported from Unity.
    * 
    * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.
    * 
    * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
    * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
    * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
    * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
    * 
    * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.unityAtlas({
    *     key: 'mainmenu',
    *     textureURL: 'images/MainMenu.png',
    *     atlasURL: 'images/MainMenu.txt'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.UnityAtlasFileConfig` for more details.
    * 
    * Once the atlas has finished loading you can use frames from it as textures for a Game Object by referencing its key:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.unityAtlas('mainmenu', 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu.json');
    * // and later in your game ...
    * this.add.image(x, y, 'mainmenu', 'background');
    * ```
    * 
    * To get a list of all available frames within an atlas please consult your Texture Atlas software.
    * 
    * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
    * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
    * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
    * 
    * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
    * 
    * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
    * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
    * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
    * 
    * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
    * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.unityAtlas('mainmenu', [ 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu-n.png' ], 'images/MainMenu.txt');
    * ```
    * 
    * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.load.unityAtlas({
    *     key: 'mainmenu',
    *     textureURL: 'images/MainMenu.png',
    *     normalMap: 'images/MainMenu-n.png',
    *     atlasURL: 'images/MainMenu.txt'
    * });
    * ```
    * 
    * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.
    * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.
    * 
    * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Unity Atlas File type has been built into Phaser.
    * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
    * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
    * @param textureURL The absolute or relative URL to load the texture image file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.png`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.png".
    * @param atlasURL The absolute or relative URL to load the texture atlas data file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.txt`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.txt".
