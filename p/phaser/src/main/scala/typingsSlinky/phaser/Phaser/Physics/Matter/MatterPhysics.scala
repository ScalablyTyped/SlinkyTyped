/**
  * The Phaser Matter plugin provides the ability to use the Matter JS Physics Engine within your Phaser games.
  * 
  * Unlike Arcade Physics, the other physics system provided with Phaser, Matter JS is a full-body physics system.
  * It features:
  * 
  * * Rigid bodies
  * * Compound bodies
  * * Composite bodies
  * * Concave and convex hulls
  * * Physical properties (mass, area, density etc.)
  * * Restitution (elastic and inelastic collisions)
  * * Collisions (broad-phase, mid-phase and narrow-phase)
  * * Stable stacking and resting
  * * Conservation of momentum
  * * Friction and resistance
  * * Constraints
  * * Gravity
  * * Sleeping and static bodies
  * * Rounded corners (chamfering)
  * * Views (translate, zoom)
  * * Collision queries (raycasting, region tests)
  * * Time scaling (slow-mo, speed-up)
  * 
  * Configuration of Matter is handled via the Matter World Config object, which can be passed in either the
  * Phaser Game Config, or Phaser Scene Config. Here is a basic example:
  * 
  * ```js
  * physics: {
  *     default: 'matter',
  *     matter: {
  *         enableSleeping: true,
  *         gravity: {
  *             y: 0
  *         },
  *         debug: {
  *             showBody: true,
  *             showStaticBody: true
  *         }
  *     }
  * }
  * ```
  * 
  * This class acts as an interface between a Phaser Scene and a single instance of the Matter Engine.
  * 
  * Use it to access the most common Matter features and helper functions.
  * 
  * You can find details, documentation and examples on the Matter JS website: https://brm.io/matter-js/

    * use of the Factory is entirely optional and should be seen as a development aid. It's

    * Aligns a Body, or Matter Game Object, against the given coordinates.

    * 
    * Although a Body has a `position` property, it is based on the center of mass for the body,
    * not a dimension based center. This makes aligning bodies difficult, especially if they have
    * rotated or scaled. This method will derive the correct position based on the body bounds and
    * its center of mass offset, in order to align the body with the given coordinate.
    * 
    * For example, if you wanted to align a body so it sat in the bottom-center of the
    * Scene, and the world was 800 x 600 in size:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.matter.alignBody(body, 400, 600, Phaser.Display.Align.BOTTOM_CENTER);
    * ```
    * 
    * You pass in 400 for the x coordinate, because that is the center of the world, and 600 for
    * the y coordinate, as that is the base of the world.
    * @param body The Body to align.
    * @param x The horizontal position to align the body to.
    * @param y The vertical position to align the body to.
    * @param align One of the `Phaser.Display.Align` constants, such as `Phaser.Display.Align.TOP_LEFT`.
