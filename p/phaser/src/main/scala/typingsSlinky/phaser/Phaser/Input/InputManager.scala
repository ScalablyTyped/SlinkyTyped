/**
  * The Input Manager is responsible for handling the pointer related systems in a single Phaser Game instance.

  * Based on the Game Config it will create handlers for mouse and touch support.

  * You rarely need to interact with the Input Manager directly, and as such, all of its properties and methods
  * should be considered private. Instead, you should use the Input Plugin, which is a Scene level system, responsible
