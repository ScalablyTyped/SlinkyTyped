/**
  * The Arc Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
  * 
  * When it renders it displays an arc shape. You can control the start and end angles of the arc,
  * as well as if the angles are winding clockwise or anti-clockwise. With the default settings
  * it renders as a complete circle. By changing the angles you can create other arc shapes,
  * such as half-circles.
  * 
  * Arcs also have an `iterations` property and corresponding `setIterations` method. This allows
  * you to control how smooth the shape renders in WebGL, by controlling the number of iterations
  * that take place during construction.
