/**
  * A Bob Game Object.
  * 
  * A Bob belongs to a Blitter Game Object. The Blitter is responsible for managing and rendering this object.
  * 
  * A Bob has a position, alpha value and a frame from a texture that it uses to render with. You can also toggle
  * the flipped and visible state of the Bob. The Frame the Bob uses to render can be changed dynamically, but it
  * must be a Frame within the Texture used by the parent Blitter.
  * 
  * Bob positions are relative to the Blitter parent. So if you move the Blitter parent, all Bob children will
  * have their positions impacted by this change as well.
  * 
  * You can manipulate Bob objects directly from your game code, but the creation and destruction of them should be
  * handled via the Blitter parent.
