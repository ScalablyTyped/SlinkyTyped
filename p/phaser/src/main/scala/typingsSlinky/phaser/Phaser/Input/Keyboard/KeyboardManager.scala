    * By default when a key is pressed Phaser will not stop the event from propagating up to the browser.
    * There are some keys this can be annoying for, like the arrow keys or space bar, which make the browser window scroll.
    * 
    * This `addCapture` method enables consuming keyboard event for specific keys so it doesn't bubble up to the the browser
    * and cause the default browser behavior.
    * 
    * Please note that keyboard captures are global. This means that if you call this method from within a Scene, to say prevent
    * the SPACE BAR from triggering a page scroll, then it will prevent it for any Scene in your game, not just the calling one.
    * 
    * You can pass in a single key code value, or an array of key codes, or a string:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.input.keyboard.addCapture(62);
    * ```

    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.input.keyboard.addCapture([ 62, 63, 64 ]);

    * 
    * Or a string:
    * 
    * ```javascript
    * this.input.keyboard.addCapture('W,S,A,D');
    * ```
    * 
    * To use non-alpha numeric keys, use a string, such as 'UP', 'SPACE' or 'LEFT'.
    * 
    * You can also provide an array mixing both strings and key code integers.
    * 
    * If there are active captures after calling this method, the `preventDefault` property is set to `true`.
    * @param keycode The Key Codes to enable capture for, preventing them reaching the browser.
