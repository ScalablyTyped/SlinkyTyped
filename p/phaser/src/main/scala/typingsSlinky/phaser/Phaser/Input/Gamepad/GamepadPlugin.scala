/**
  * The Gamepad Plugin is an input plugin that belongs to the Scene-owned Input system.
  * 
  * Its role is to listen for native DOM Gamepad Events and then process them.
  * 
  * You do not need to create this class directly, the Input system will create an instance of it automatically.
  * 
  * You can access it from within a Scene using `this.input.gamepad`.
  * 
  * To listen for a gamepad being connected:
  * 
  * ```javascript
  * this.input.gamepad.once('connected', function (pad) {
  *     //   'pad' is a reference to the gamepad that was just connected
  * });
  * ```
  * 
  * Note that the browser may require you to press a button on a gamepad before it will allow you to access it,
  * this is for security reasons. However, it may also trust the page already, in which case you won't get the
  * 'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads
  * already connected.
  * 
  * Once you have received the connected event, or polled the gamepads and found them enabled, you can access
  * them via the built-in properties `GamepadPlugin.pad1` to `pad4`, for up to 4 game pads. With a reference
  * to the gamepads you can poll its buttons and axis sticks. See the properties and methods available on
  * the `Gamepad` class for more details.
  *
