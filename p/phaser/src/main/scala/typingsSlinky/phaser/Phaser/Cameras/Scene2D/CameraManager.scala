/**
  * The Camera Manager is a plugin that belongs to a Scene and is responsible for managing all of the Scene Cameras.
  * 
  * By default you can access the Camera Manager from within a Scene using `this.cameras`, although this can be changed
  * in your game config.
  * 
  * Create new Cameras using the `add` method. Or extend the Camera class with your own addition code and then add
  * the new Camera in using the `addExisting` method.
  * 
  * Cameras provide a view into your game world, and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.
  * 
  * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.
  * 
  * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are
  * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
  * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
  * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).
  * 
  * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
  * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the
  * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.
  * 
  * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,
  * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis. The Camera Manager can manage up to 31 unique 
  * 'Game Object ignore capable' Cameras. Any Cameras beyond 31 that you create will all be given a Camera ID of
  * zero, meaning that they cannot be used for Game Object exclusion. This means if you need your Camera to ignore
  * Game Objects, make sure it's one of the first 31 created.
  * 
  * A Camera also has built-in special effects including Fade, Flash, Camera Shake, Pan and Zoom.

  /**
    * Adds a new Camera into the Camera Manager. The Camera Manager can support up to 31 different Cameras.
    * 
    * Each Camera has its own viewport, which controls the size of the Camera and its position within the canvas.
    * 
    * Use the `Camera.scrollX` and `Camera.scrollY` properties to change where the Camera is looking, or the
    * Camera methods such as `centerOn`. Cameras also have built in special effects, such as fade, flash, shake,
    * pan and zoom.
    * 
    * By default Cameras are transparent and will render anything that they can see based on their `scrollX`
    * and `scrollY` values. Game Objects can be set to be ignored by a Camera by using the `Camera.ignore` method.
    * 
    * The Camera will have its `roundPixels` property set to whatever `CameraManager.roundPixels` is. You can change
    * it after creation if required.
    * 
    * See the Camera class documentation for more details.

    * @param height The height of the Camera viewport. If not given it'll be the game config size.
    * @param makeMain Set this Camera as being the 'main' camera. This just makes the property `main` a reference to it. Default false.
    * @param name The name of the Camera. Default ''.
