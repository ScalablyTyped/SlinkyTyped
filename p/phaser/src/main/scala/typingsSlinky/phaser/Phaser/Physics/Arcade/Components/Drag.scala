    * the game Asteroids) then you will get a far smoother and more visually correct deceleration
    * by using damping, avoiding the axis-drift that is prone with linear deceleration.
    * 
    * If you enable this property then you should use far smaller `drag` values than with linear, as
    * they are used as a multiplier on the velocity. Values such as 0.95 will give a nice slow
    * deceleration, where-as smaller values, such as 0.5 will stop an object almost immediately.
    * @param value `true` to use damping for deceleration, or `false` to use linear deceleration.
