/**
  * The Star Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
  * 
  * As the name implies, the Star shape will display a star in your game. You can control several
  * aspects of it including the number of points that constitute the star. The default is 5. If
  * you change it to 4 it will render as a diamond. If you increase them, you'll get a more spiky
  * star shape.
  * 
  * You can also control the inner and outer radius, which is how 'long' each point of the star is.
  * Modify these values to create more interesting shapes.
