/**
  * A TileSprite is a Sprite that has a repeating texture.
  * 
  * The texture can be scrolled and scaled independently of the TileSprite itself. Textures will automatically wrap and
  * are designed so that you can create game backdrops using seamless textures as a source.
  * 
  * You shouldn't ever create a TileSprite any larger than your actual canvas size. If you want to create a large repeating background
  * that scrolls across the whole map of your game, then you create a TileSprite that fits the canvas size and then use the `tilePosition`
  * property to scroll the texture as the player moves. If you create a TileSprite that is thousands of pixels in size then it will 
  * consume huge amounts of memory and cause performance issues. Remember: use `tilePosition` to scroll your texture and `tileScale` to
  * adjust the scale of the texture - don't resize the sprite itself or make it larger than it needs.
  * 
  * An important note about Tile Sprites and NPOT textures: Internally, TileSprite textures use GL_REPEAT to provide
  * seamless repeating of the textures. This, combined with the way in which the textures are handled in WebGL, means
  * they need to be POT (power-of-two) sizes in order to wrap. If you provide a NPOT (non power-of-two) texture to a
  * TileSprite it will generate a POT sized canvas and draw your texture to it, scaled up to the POT size. It's then
  * scaled back down again during rendering to the original dimensions. While this works, in that it allows you to use
  * any size texture for a Tile Sprite, it does mean that NPOT textures are going to appear anti-aliased when rendered,
  * due to the interpolation that took place when it was resized into a POT texture. This is especially visible in
  * pixel art graphics. If you notice it and it becomes an issue, the only way to avoid it is to ensure that you
  * provide POT textures for Tile Sprites.
