/**
  * An Image Game Object.
  * 
  * An Image is a light-weight Game Object useful for the display of static images in your game,
  * such as logos, backgrounds, scenery or other non-animated elements. Images can have input
  * events and physics bodies, or be tweened, tinted or scrolled. The main difference between an
  * Image and a Sprite is that you cannot animate an Image as they do not have the Animation component.
