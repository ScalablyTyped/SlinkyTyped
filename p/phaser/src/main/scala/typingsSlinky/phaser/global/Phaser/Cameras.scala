      * 
      * The Camera is the way in which all games are rendered in Phaser. They provide a view into your game world,
      * and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.
      * 
      * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.
      * 
      * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are
      * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
      * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
      * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).
      * 
      * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
      * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the
      * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.
      * 
      * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,
      * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis.
      * 
      * The Base Camera is extended by the Camera class, which adds in special effects including Fade,
      * Flash and Camera Shake, as well as the ability to follow Game Objects.
      * 
      * The Base Camera was introduced in Phaser 3.12. It was split off from the Camera class, to allow
      * you to isolate special effects as needed. Therefore the 'since' values for properties of this class relate
      * to when they were added to the Camera class.
