/**
  * The JavaScript application communicates to the server using a {@link Paho.MQTT.Client} object.
  *
  * Most applications will create just one Client object and then call its connect() method,
  * however applications can create more than one Client object if they wish.
  * In this case the combination of host, port and clientId attributes must be different for each Client object.
  *
  * The send, subscribe and unsubscribe methods are implemented as asynchronous JavaScript methods
  * (even though the underlying protocol exchange might be synchronous in nature).
  * This means they signal their completion by calling back to the application,
  * via Success or Failure callback functions provided by the application on the method in question.
  * Such callbacks are called at most once per method invocation and do not persist beyond the lifetime
  * of the script that made the invocation.
  *
  * In contrast there are some callback functions, most notably {@link onMessageArrived},
  * that are defined on the {@link Paho.MQTT.Client} object.
  * These may get called multiple times, and aren't directly related to specific method invocations made by the
  * client.
