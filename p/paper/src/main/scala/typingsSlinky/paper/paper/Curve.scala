  * The Curve object represents the parts of a path that are connected by
  * two following {@link Segment} objects. The curves of a path can be accessed
  * through its {@link Path#curves} array.
  * 
  * While a segment describe the anchor point and its incoming and outgoing
  * handles, a Curve object describes the curve passing between two such
  * segments. Curves and segments represent two different ways of looking at the
  * same thing, but focusing on different aspects. Curves for example offer many
