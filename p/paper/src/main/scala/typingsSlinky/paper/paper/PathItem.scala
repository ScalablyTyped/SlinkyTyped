    * or moving the segments' locations, by smoothing and adjusting the angle
    * and length of the segments' handles based on the position and distance of
    * neighboring segments.
    * 
    * Smoothing works both for open paths and closed paths, and can be applied
    * to the full path, as well as a sub-range of it. If a range is defined
    * using the `options.from` and `options.to` properties, only the curve
    * handles inside that range are touched. If one or both limits of the range
    * are specified in negative indices, the indices are wrapped around the end
    * of the curve. That way, a smoothing range in a close path can even wrap
    * around the connection between the last and the first segment.
    * 
    * Four different smoothing methods are available:
    * 
    * - `'continuous'` smooths the path item by adjusting its curve handles so
    *     that the first and second derivatives of all involved curves are
    *     continuous across their boundaries.
    * 
    *     This method tends to result in the smoothest results, but does not
    *     allow for further parametrization of the handles.
    * 
    * - `'asymmetric'` is based on the same principle as `'continuous'` but
    *     uses different factors so that the result is asymmetric. This used to
    *     the only method available until v0.10.0, and is currently still the
    *     default when no method is specified, for reasons of backward
    *     compatibility. It will eventually be removed.
    * 
    * - `'catmull-rom'` uses the Catmull-Rom spline to smooth the segment.
    * 
    *     The optionally passed factor controls the knot parametrization of the
    *     algorithm:
    * 
    *     - `0.0`: the standard, uniform Catmull-Rom spline
    *     - `0.5`: the centripetal Catmull-Rom spline, guaranteeing no
    *         self-intersections
    *     - `1.0`: the chordal Catmull-Rom spline
    * 
    * - `'geometric'` use a simple heuristic and empiric geometric method to
    *     smooth the segment's handles. The handles were weighted, meaning that
    *     big differences in distances between the segments will lead to
    *     probably undesired results.
    * 
    *     The optionally passed factor defines the tension parameter (`0...1`),
    *     controlling the amount of smoothing as a factor by which to scale
    *     each handle.
    * 
    * @see Segment#smooth([options])
    * 
    * @option [options.type='asymmetric'] {String} the type of smoothing
