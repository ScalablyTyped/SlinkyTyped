/** 
  * An affine transformation matrix performs a linear mapping from 2D
  *     coordinates to other 2D coordinates that preserves the "straightness" and
  *     "parallelness" of lines.
  * 
  * Such a coordinate transformation can be represented by a 3 row by 3
  * column matrix with an implied last row of `[ 0 0 1 ]`. This matrix
  * transforms source coordinates `(x, y)` into destination coordinates `(x',y')`
  * by considering them to be a column vector and multiplying the coordinate
  * vector by the matrix according to the following process:
  * 
  *     [ x ]   [ a  c  tx ] [ x ]   [ a * x + c * y + tx ]
  *     [ y ] = [ b  d  ty ] [ y ] = [ b * x + d * y + ty ]
  *     [ 1 ]   [ 0  0  1  ] [ 1 ]   [         1          ]
  * 
  * Note the locations of b and c.
  * 
  * This class is optimized for speed and minimizes calculations based on its
  * knowledge of the underlying matrix (as opposed to say simply performing
  * matrix multiplication).
