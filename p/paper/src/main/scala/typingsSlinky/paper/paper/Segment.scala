    * 
    *     - `0.0`: the standard, uniform Catmull-Rom spline
    *     - `0.5`: the centripetal Catmull-Rom spline, guaranteeing no
    *         self-intersections
    *     - `1.0`: the chordal Catmull-Rom spline
    * 
    * - `'geometric'` use a simple heuristic and empiric geometric method to
    *     smooth the segment's handles. The handles were weighted, meaning that
    *     big differences in distances between the segments will lead to
    *     probably undesired results.
    * 
    *     The optionally passed factor defines the tension parameter (`0...1`),
    *     controlling the amount of smoothing as a factor by which to scale
    *     each handle.
