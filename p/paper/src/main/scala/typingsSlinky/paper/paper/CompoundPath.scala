/** 
  * A compound path is a complex path that is made up of one or more
  * simple sub-paths. It can have the `nonzero` fill rule, or the `evenodd` rule
  * applied. Both rules use mathematical equations to determine if any region is
  * outside or inside the final shape. The `evenodd` rule is more predictable:
  * Every other region within a such a compound path is a hole, regardless of
  * path direction.
  * 
  * All the paths in a compound path take on the style of the compound path and
  * can be accessed through its {@link Item#children} list.
