/**
  * Represents a LiveQuery Subscription.
  *
  * @see https://docs.parseplatform.org/js/guide/#live-queries
  * @see NodeJS.EventEmitter
  *
  * Events list
  * ---
  * `open` - when you call `query.subscribe()`, we send a subscribe request to
  * the LiveQuery server, when we get the confirmation from the LiveQuery server,
  * this event will be emitted. When the client loses WebSocket connection to the
  * LiveQuery server, we will try to auto reconnect the LiveQuery server. If we
  * reconnect the LiveQuery server and successfully resubscribe the ParseQuery,
  * you'll also get this event.
  *
  * ```
  * subscription.on('open', () => {});
  * ```
  * ---
  * `create` - when a new ParseObject is created and it fulfills the ParseQuery you subscribe,
  * you'll get this event. The object is the ParseObject which is created.
  *
  * ```
  * subscription.on('create', (object: Parse.Object) => {});
  * ```
  * ---
  * `update` event - when an existing ParseObject which fulfills the ParseQuery you subscribe
  * is updated (The ParseObject fulfills the ParseQuery before and after changes),
  * you'll get this event. The object is the ParseObject which is updated.
  * Its content is the latest value of the ParseObject.
  *
  * ```
  * subscription.on('update', (object: Parse.Object) => {});
  * ```
  * ---
  * `enter` event - when an existing ParseObject's old value doesn't fulfill the ParseQuery
  * but its new value fulfills the ParseQuery, you'll get this event. The object is the
  * ParseObject which enters the ParseQuery. Its content is the latest value of the ParseObject.
  *
  * ```
  * subscription.on('enter', (object: Parse.Object) => {});
  * ```
  * ---
  * `update` event - when an existing ParseObject's old value fulfills the ParseQuery but its new value
  * doesn't fulfill the ParseQuery, you'll get this event. The object is the ParseObject
  * which leaves the ParseQuery. Its content is the latest value of the ParseObject.
  *
  * ```
  * subscription.on('leave', (object: Parse.Object) => {});
  * ```
  * ---
  * `delete` event - when an existing ParseObject which fulfills the ParseQuery is deleted, you'll
  * get this event. The object is the ParseObject which is deleted.
  *
  * ```
  * subscription.on('delete', (object: Parse.Object) => {});
  * ```
  * ---
  * `close` event - when the client loses the WebSocket connection to the LiveQuery
  * server and we stop receiving events, you'll get this event.
  *
  * ```
  * subscription.on('close', () => {});
  * ```
