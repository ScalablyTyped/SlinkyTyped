  /**
    *   Called directly after setup(), the draw() function
    *   continuously executes the lines of code contained
    *   inside its block until the program is stopped or
    *   noLoop() is called. Note if noLoop() is called in
    *   setup(), draw() will still be executed once before
    *   stopping. draw() is called automatically and
    *   should never be called explicitly.  It should
    *   always be controlled with noLoop(), redraw() and
    *   loop(). After noLoop() stops the code in draw()
    *   from executing, redraw() causes the code inside
    *   draw() to execute once, and loop() will cause the
    *   code inside draw() to resume executing
    *   continuously.
    *
    *
    *   The number of times draw() executes in each second
    *   may be controlled with the frameRate() function.
    *
    *
    *   There can only be one draw() function for each
    *   sketch, and draw() must exist if you want the code
    *   to run continuously, or to process events such as
    *   mousePressed(). Sometimes, you might have an empty
    *   call to draw() in your program, as shown in the
    *   above example.
    *
    *
    *   It is important to note that the drawing
    *   coordinate system will be reset at the beginning
    *   of each draw() call. If any transformations are
    *   performed within draw() (ex: scale, rotate,
    *   translate), their effects will be undone at the
    *   beginning of draw(), so transformations will not
    *   accumulate over time. On the other hand, styling
    *   applied (ex: fill, stroke, etc) will remain in
    *   effect.

    *   function. If asynchronous loading is preferred,
    *   the load methods can instead be called in setup()

    *   parameter.  By default the text "loading..." will
    *   be displayed. To make your own loading page,
