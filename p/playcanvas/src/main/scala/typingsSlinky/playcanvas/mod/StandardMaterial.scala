/**
  * A Standard material is the main, general purpose material that is most often used for rendering.
  * It can approximate a wide variety of surface types and can simulate dynamic reflected light.
  * Most maps can use 3 types of input values in any combination: constant (color or number), mesh vertex colors and a texture. All enabled inputs are multiplied together.
  * @example
  * // Create a new Standard material
  * var material = new pc.StandardMaterial();
  *
  * // Update the material's diffuse and specular properties
  * material.diffuse.set(1, 0, 0);
  * material.specular.set(1, 1, 1);
  *
  * // Notify the material that it has been modified
  * material.update();
