  * Local - represents a tracking space with a native origin near the viewer at the time of creation.
  * The exact position and orientation will be initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform.
  * When using this reference space the user is not expected to move beyond their initial position much, if at all,
  * and tracking is optimized for that purpose. For devices with 6DoF tracking, local reference spaces should
  * emphasize keeping the origin stable relative to the userâ€™s environment.
