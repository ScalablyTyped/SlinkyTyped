/**
  * Local Floor - represents a tracking space with a native origin at the floor in a safe position for
  * the user to stand. The y axis equals 0 at floor level, with the x and z position and orientation initialized
  * based on the conventions of the underlying platform. Floor level value might be estimated by the underlying
  * platform. When using this reference space, the user is not expected to move beyond their initial position much,
  * if at all, and tracking is optimized for that purpose. For devices with 6DoF tracking, local-floor reference
  * spaces should emphasize keeping the origin stable relative to the userâ€™s environment.
