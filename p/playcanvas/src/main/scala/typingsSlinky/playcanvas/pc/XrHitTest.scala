    * Attempts to start hit test with provided reference space.
    * @example
    * app.xr.hitTest.start({

    *             // based on Ray facing forward from the Viewer reference space
    *         });
    *     }

    * @example
    * var ray = new pc.Ray(new pc.Vec3(0, 0, 0), new pc.Vec3(0, -1, 0));
    * app.xr.hitTest.start({

    *         // from the position where AR session started
    *     }

    * @example
    * app.xr.hitTest.start({

    *         if (err) return;

    * @param [options] - Optional object for passing arguments.
    * @param [options.spaceType] - Reference space type. Defaults to {@link pc.XRSPACE_VIEWER}. Can be one of the following:
    *
    * * {@link pc.XRSPACE_VIEWER}: Viewer - hit test will be facing relative to viewers space.
    * * {@link pc.XRSPACE_LOCAL}: Local - represents a tracking space with a native origin near the viewer at the time of creation.
    * * {@link pc.XRSPACE_LOCALFLOOR}: Local Floor - represents a tracking space with a native origin at the floor in a safe position for the user to stand. The y axis equals 0 at floor level. Floor level value might be estimated by the underlying platform.
    * * {@link pc.XRSPACE_BOUNDEDFLOOR}: Bounded Floor - represents a tracking space with its native origin at the floor, where the user is expected to move within a pre-established boundary.
    * * {@link pc.XRSPACE_UNBOUNDED}: Unbounded - represents a tracking space where the user is expected to move freely around their environment, potentially long distances from their starting point.
    * @param [options.profile] - if hit test source meant to match input source instead of reference space, then name of profile of the {@link pc.XrInputSource} should be provided.
    * @param [options.entityTypes] - Optional list of underlying entity types against which hit tests will be performed. Defaults to [ {pc.XRTRACKABLE_PLANE} ]. Can be any combination of the following:
    *
    * * {@link pc.XRTRACKABLE_POINT}: Point - indicates that the hit test results will be computed based on the feature points detected by the underlying Augmented Reality system.
    * * {@link pc.XRTRACKABLE_PLANE}: Plane - indicates that the hit test results will be computed based on the planes detected by the underlying Augmented Reality system.
    * * {@link pc.XRTRACKABLE_MESH}: Mesh - indicates that the hit test results will be computed based on the meshes detected by the underlying Augmented Reality system.
    * @param [options.offsetRay] - Optional ray by which hit test ray can be offset.
    * @param [options.callback] - Optional callback function called once hit test source is created or failed.
