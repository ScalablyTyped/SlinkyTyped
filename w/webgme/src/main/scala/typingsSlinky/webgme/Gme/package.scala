    * The eventHandler is invoked whenever there are 
    * changes to the nodes matching any of the patterns.
    *  There are three cases when it is triggered:
    *   - updateTerritory was invoked by us.
    *   - Another client made changes to nodes within the territory.
    *   - We made changes to any of the nodes (via the setters).
    * 
    *  * ('load')
    * The node is loaded and we have access to it.
    * It was either just created or this is the initial updateTerritory we invoked.
    *  * ('update') 
    * There were changes to the node (some might not apply to your application).
    * The node is still loaded and we have access to it.
    *  * ('unload')
    * The node was removed from the model (we can no longer access it).
    * We still get the path/id via events[i].eid
    *  * (else)
    * "Technical events" not used.
