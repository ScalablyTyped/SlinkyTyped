/**
  * ### Service Overview The IBM&reg; Text to Speech service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-synthesis capabilities to synthesize text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages, dialects, and voices. The service supports at least one male or female voice, sometimes both, for each language. The audio is streamed back to the client with minimal delay.   For speech synthesis, the service supports a synchronous HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST) interface. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides both plain text and SSML input, including the SSML &lt;mark&gt; element and word timings. SSML is an XML-based markup language that provides text annotation for speech-synthesis applications.   The service also offers a customization interface. You can use the interface to define sounds-like or phonetic translations for words. A sounds-like translation consists of one or more words that, when combined, sound like the word. A phonetic translation is based on the SSML phoneme format for representing a word. You can specify a phonetic translation in standard International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation or in the proprietary IBM Symbolic Phonetic Representation (SPR).

    *
    *  The service can return audio in the following formats (MIME types).
    * * Where indicated, you can optionally specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio. You must specify a sampling
    * rate for the `audio/l16` and `audio/mulaw` formats. A specified sampling rate must lie in the range of 8 kHz to 192
    * kHz.
    * * For the `audio/l16` format, you can optionally specify the endianness (`endianness`) of the audio:
    * `endianness=big-endian` or `endianness=little-endian`.
    *
    * Use the `Accept` header or the `accept` parameter to specify the requested format of the response audio. If you
    * omit an audio format altogether, the service returns the audio in Ogg format with the Opus codec
    * (`audio/ogg;codecs=opus`). The service always returns single-channel audio.
    * * `audio/basic`
    *
    *   The service returns audio with a sampling rate of 8000 Hz.
    * * `audio/flac`
    *
    *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    * * `audio/l16`
    *
    *   You must specify the `rate` of the audio. You can optionally specify the `endianness` of the audio. The default
    * endianness is `little-endian`.
    * * `audio/mp3`
    *
    *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    * * `audio/mpeg`
    *
    *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    * * `audio/mulaw`
    *
    *   You must specify the `rate` of the audio.
    * * `audio/ogg`
    *
    *   The service returns the audio in the `vorbis` codec. You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The
    * default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
    *
    *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
    *
    *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    * * `audio/wav`
    *
    *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    * * `audio/webm`
    *
    *   The service returns the audio in the `opus` codec. The service returns audio with a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz.
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
    *
    *   The service returns audio with a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz.
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
    *
    *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
    *

    * ### Warning messages
    *
    *  If a request includes invalid query parameters, the service returns a `Warnings` response header that provides
    * messages about the invalid parameters. The warning includes a descriptive message and a list of invalid argument
    * strings. For example, a message such as `\"Unknown arguments:\"` or `\"Unknown url query arguments:\"` followed by
    * a list of the form `\"{invalid_arg_1}, {invalid_arg_2}.\"` The request succeeds despite the warnings.
    *
    * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
    * @param {string} params.text - The text to synthesize.
    * @param {string} [params.voice] - The voice to use for synthesis.
    * @param {string} [params.customization_id] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom voice model to use for the
    * synthesis. If a custom voice model is specified, it is guaranteed to work only if it matches the language of the
    * indicated voice. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that
    * owns the custom model. Omit the parameter to use the specified voice with no customization.
    * @param {string} [params.accept] - The requested format (MIME type) of the audio. You can use the `Accept` header or
    * the `accept` parameter to specify the audio format. For more information about specifying an audio format, see
    * **Audio formats (accept types)** in the method description.
    *
    * Default: `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`.
    * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom request headers
    * @param {Function} [callback] - The callback that handles the response.
    * @returns {Promise<any>|void}

  /**
    * Update a custom model.
    *
    * Updates information for the specified custom voice model. You can update metadata such as the name and description
    * of the voice model. You can also update the words in the model and their translations. Adding a new translation for
    * a word that already exists in a custom model overwrites the word's existing translation. A custom model can contain
    * no more than 20,000 entries. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to update
    * it.
    *
    * You can define sounds-like or phonetic translations for words. A sounds-like translation consists of one or more
    * words that, when combined, sound like the word. Phonetic translations are based on the SSML phoneme format for
    * representing a word. You can specify them in standard International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation
    *
    *   <code>&lt;phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"t&#601;m&#712;&#593;to\"&gt;&lt;/phoneme&gt;</code>
    *
    *   or in the proprietary IBM Symbolic Phonetic Representation (SPR)
    *
    *   <code>&lt;phoneme alphabet=\"ibm\" ph=\"1gAstroEntxrYFXs\"&gt;&lt;/phoneme&gt;</code>
