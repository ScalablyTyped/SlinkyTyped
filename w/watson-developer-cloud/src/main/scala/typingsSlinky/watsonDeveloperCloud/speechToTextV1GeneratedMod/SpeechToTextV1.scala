/**
  * The IBM&reg; Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-recognition capabilities to produce transcripts of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. In addition to basic transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For most languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON response content in the UTF-8 character set.   For speech recognition, the service supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication channel: Clients send requests and audio to the service and receive results over a single connection asynchronously.   The service also offers two customization interfaces. Use language model customization to expand the vocabulary of a base model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model customization to adapt a base model for the acoustic characteristics of your audio. For language model customization, the service also supports grammars. A grammar is a formal language specification that lets you restrict the phrases that the service can recognize.   Language model customization is generally available for production use with most supported languages. Acoustic model customization is beta functionality that is available for all supported languages.

  /**
    * Add an audio resource.
    *
    * Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model. Add audio content that reflects the acoustic characteristics of
    * the audio that you plan to transcribe. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model
    * to add an audio resource to it. Adding audio data does not affect the custom acoustic model until you train the
    * model for the new data by using the **Train a custom acoustic model** method.
    *
    * You can add individual audio files or an archive file that contains multiple audio files. Adding multiple audio
    * files via a single archive file is significantly more efficient than adding each file individually. You can add
    * audio resources in any format that the service supports for speech recognition.
    *
    * You can use this method to add any number of audio resources to a custom model by calling the method once for each
    * audio or archive file. But the addition of one audio resource must be fully complete before you can add another.
    * You must add a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 100 hours of audio that includes speech, not just silence, to
    * a custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio resource, audio- or archive-type, can be larger than 100
    * MB. To add an audio resource that has the same name as an existing audio resource, set the `allow_overwrite`
    * parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails.
    *
    * The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds to complete depending on the duration of the audio and, in
    * the case of an archive file, the total number of audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response
    * code if the audio is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files and
    * automatically extracts information about the audio such as its length, sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot
    * submit requests to add additional audio resources to a custom acoustic model, or to train the model, until the
    * service's analysis of all audio files for the current request completes.
    *
    * To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the **Get an audio resource** method to poll
    * the status of the audio. The method accepts the customization ID of the custom model and the name of the audio
    * resource, and it returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio every few seconds
    * until it becomes `ok`.
    *
    * **See also:** [Add audio to the custom acoustic
    * model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/acoustic-create.html#addAudio).
    *
    * ### Content types for audio-type resources
    *
    *  You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. For an
    * audio-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio file,
    * including specifying the sampling rate, channels, and endianness where indicated.
    * * `audio/alaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
    * * `audio/flac`
    * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
    * * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`) and endianness
    * (`endianness`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/mp3`
    * * `audio/mpeg`
    * * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
    * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
    * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
    *
    * The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model for the custom model: for
    * broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is
    * higher than the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling
    * rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
    *
    *  **See also:** [Audio formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
    *
    * ### Content types for archive-type resources
    *
    *  You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio files in any format that the
    * service supports for speech recognition. For an archive-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify
    * the media type of the archive file:
    * * `application/zip` for a **.zip** file
    * * `application/gzip` for a **.tar.gz** file.
    *
    * When you add an archive-type resource, the `Contained-Content-Type` header is optional depending on the format of
    * the files that you are adding:
    * * For audio files of type `audio/alaw`, `audio/basic`, `audio/l16`, or `audio/mulaw`, you must use the
    * `Contained-Content-Type` header to specify the format of the contained audio files. Include the `rate`, `channels`,
    * and `endianness` parameters where necessary. In this case, all audio files contained in the archive file must have
    * the same audio format.
    * * For audio files of all other types, you can omit the `Contained-Content-Type` header. In this case, the audio
    * files contained in the archive file can have any of the formats not listed in the previous bullet. The audio files
    * do not need to have the same format.
    *
    * Do not use the `Contained-Content-Type` header when adding an audio-type resource.
    *
    * ### Naming restrictions for embedded audio files
    *
    *  The name of an audio file that is embedded within an archive-type resource must meet the following restrictions:
    * * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the file name; this includes the file extension.
    * * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the file name.
    * * Do not use the name of an audio file that has already been added to the custom model as part of an archive-type
    * resource.
    *
    * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
    * @param {string} params.customization_id - The customization ID (GUID) of the custom acoustic model that is to be
    * used for the request. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the
    * custom model.
    * @param {string} params.audio_name - The name of the new audio resource for the custom acoustic model. Use a
    * localized name that matches the language of the custom model and reflects the contents of the resource.
    * * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
    * * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the name.
    * * Do not use the name of an audio resource that has already been added to the custom model.
    * @param {NodeJS.ReadableStream|FileObject|Buffer} params.audio_resource - The audio resource that is to be added to
    * the custom acoustic model, an individual audio file or an archive file.
    * @param {string} [params.contained_content_type] - **For an archive-type resource,** specify the format of the audio
    * files that are contained in the archive file if they are of type `audio/alaw`, `audio/basic`, `audio/l16`, or
    * `audio/mulaw`. Include the `rate`, `channels`, and `endianness` parameters where necessary. In this case, all audio
    * files that are contained in the archive file must be of the indicated type.
    *
    * For all other audio formats, you can omit the header. In this case, the audio files can be of multiple types as
    * long as they are not of the types listed in the previous paragraph.
    *
    * The parameter accepts all of the audio formats that are supported for use with speech recognition. For more
    * information, see **Content types for audio-type resources** in the method description.
    *
    * **For an audio-type resource,** omit the header.
    * @param {boolean} [params.allow_overwrite] - If `true`, the specified audio resource overwrites an existing audio
    * resource with the same name. If `false`, the request fails if an audio resource with the same name already exists.
    * The parameter has no effect if an audio resource with the same name does not already exist.
    * @param {string} [params.content_type] - For an audio-type resource, the format (MIME type) of the audio. For more
    * information, see **Content types for audio-type resources** in the method description.
    *
    * For an archive-type resource, the media type of the archive file. For more information, see **Content types for
    * archive-type resources** in the method description.
    * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom request headers
    * @param {Function} [callback] - The callback that handles the response.

  /**
    * Add a corpus.
    *
    * Adds a single corpus text file of new training data to a custom language model. Use multiple requests to submit

    * to add them to the model's words resource. The time that it takes for the analysis to complete depends on the
    * number of new words that you add but is generally faster than adding a corpus or grammar.
    *
    * You can monitor the status of the request by using the **List a custom language model** method to poll the model's
    * status. Use a loop to check the status every 10 seconds. The method returns a `Customization` object that includes
    * a `status` field. A status of `ready` means that the words have been added to the custom model. The service cannot
    * accept requests to add new data or to train the model until the existing request completes.
    *
    * You can use the **List custom words** or **List a custom word** method to review the words that you add. Words with
    * an invalid `sounds_like` field include an `error` field that describes the problem. You can use other words-related
    * methods to correct errors, eliminate typos, and modify how words are pronounced as needed.

  /**
    * Create a job.
    *
    * Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the instance of the service whose
    * credentials are used to create it. How you learn the status and results of a job depends on the parameters you
    * include with the job creation request:
    * * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` parameter to specify a URL to which the service is to send
    * callback notifications when the status of the job changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and
    * `user_token` parameters to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included with each
    * notification for the job.
    * * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token` parameters. You must then use the
    * **Check jobs** or **Check a job** methods to check the status of the job, using the latter to retrieve the results
    * when the job is complete.
    *
    * The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job status or obtain results from the
    * service manually even if you include a callback URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to
    * specify how long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. Using the HTTPS **Check a job**
    * method to retrieve results is more secure than receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it
    * provides confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.
    *
    * The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket recognition requests. It also supports
    * the following parameters specific to the asynchronous interface:
    * * `callback_url`
    * * `events`
    * * `user_token`
    * * `results_ttl`
    *
    * You can pass a maximum of 1 GB and a minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The service automatically
    * detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to
    * one-channel mono during transcoding. The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use the
    * WebSocket API.
    *
    * **See also:** [Creating a job](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#create).
    *
    * ### Streaming mode
    *
    *  For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
    * `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the service closes the connection (status code 408) if it does
    * not receive at least 15 seconds of audio (including silence) in any 30-second period. The service also closes the
    * connection (status code 400) if it detects no speech for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of streaming audio; use the
    * `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
    *
    * **See also:**
    * * [Audio transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
    * * [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts)
    *
    * ### Audio formats (content types)
    *
    *  The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
    * * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
    * format of the audio.
    * * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
    * header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
    * either `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
    *
    * Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
    * of channels and the endianness of the audio.
    * * `audio/alaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
    * * `audio/flac`
    * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
    * * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
    * and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/mp3`
    * * `audio/mpeg`
    * * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
    * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
    * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
    *
    * The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the recognition request: for broadband
    * models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than
    * the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the
    * audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request fails.
    *
    *  **See also:** [Audio formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
    *
    * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
    * @param {NodeJS.ReadableStream|FileObject|Buffer} params.audio - The audio to transcribe.
    * @param {string} [params.model] - The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request. See
    * [Languages and models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/models.html).
    * @param {string} [params.callback_url] - A URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. The URL must already
    * be successfully white-listed by using the **Register a callback** method. You can include the same callback URL
    * with any number of job creation requests. Omit the parameter to poll the service for job completion and results.
    *
    * Use the `user_token` parameter to specify a unique user-specified string with each job to differentiate the
    * callback notifications for the jobs.
    * @param {string} [params.events] - If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of notification events
    * to which to subscribe. Valid events are
    * * `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins to process the job.
    * * `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. You must use the **Check a
    * job** method to retrieve the results before they time out or are deleted.
    * * `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. The
    * notification includes the results of the request.
    * * `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service experiences an error while processing the
    * job.
    *
    * The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are incompatible. You can specify
    * only of the two events.
    *
    * If the job includes a callback URL, omit the parameter to subscribe to the default events: `recognitions.started`,
    * `recognitions.completed`, and `recognitions.failed`. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the
    * parameter.
    * @param {string} [params.user_token] - If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string that the service
    * is to include with each callback notification for the job; the token allows the user to maintain an internal
    * mapping between jobs and notification events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter.
    * @param {number} [params.results_ttl] - The number of minutes for which the results are to be available after the
    * job has finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results must be retrieved within this time. Omit the
    * parameter to use a time to live of one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.
    * @param {string} [params.language_customization_id] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is
    * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model
    * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
    * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Custom
    * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom-input).
    *
    * **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id` parameter.
    * @param {string} [params.acoustic_customization_id] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is
    * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model
    * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
    * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Custom
    * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom-input).
    * @param {string} [params.base_model_version] - The version of the specified base model that is to be used with
    * recognition request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements.
    * The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
    * default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Base model
    * version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
    * @param {number} [params.customization_weight] - If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language
    * model with the recognition request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words
    * from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.
    *
    * Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model
    * when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was
    * specified when the custom model was trained.
    *
    * The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of
    * OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of
    * phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
    *
    * See [Custom models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom-input).
    * @param {number} [params.inactivity_timeout] - The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is
    * detected in streaming audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio
    * submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See [Inactivity
    * timeout](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts-inactivity).
    * @param {string[]} [params.keywords] - An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can
    * include one or more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If
    * you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit
    * the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords. See [Keyword
    * spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
    * @param {number} [params.keywords_threshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A
    * word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a
    * probability between 0.0 and 1.0. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. The
    * service performs no keyword spotting if you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
    * spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
    * @param {number} [params.max_alternatives] - The maximum number of alternative transcripts that the service is to
    * return. By default, the service returns a single transcript. If you specify a value of `0`, the service uses the
    * default value, `1`. See [Maximum
    * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#max_alternatives).
    * @param {number} [params.word_alternatives_threshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a
    * hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered
    * if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. By default,
    * the service computes no alternative words. See [Word
    * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_alternatives).
    * @param {boolean} [params.word_confidence] - If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure in the range of 0.0
    * to 1.0 for each word. By default, the service returns no word confidence scores. See [Word
    * confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_confidence).
    * @param {boolean} [params.timestamps] - If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no
    * timestamps are returned. See [Word
    * timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_timestamps).
    * @param {boolean} [params.profanity_filter] - If `true`, the service filters profanity from all output except for
    * keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return
    * results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
    * filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#profanity_filter).
    * @param {boolean} [params.smart_formatting] - If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and
    * numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in
    * the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to
    * punctuation symbols. By default, the service performs no smart formatting.
    *
    * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
    *
    * See [Smart formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#smart_formatting).
    * @param {boolean} [params.speaker_labels] - If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were
    * spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, the service returns no speaker labels. Setting
    * `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify
    * `false` for the parameter.
    *
    * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only. To determine whether a language model
    * supports speaker labels, you can also use the **Get a model** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels`
    * is set to `true`.
    *
    * See [Speaker labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
    * @param {string} [params.customization_id] - **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id` parameter to
    * specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request. Do
    * not specify both parameters with a request.
    * @param {string} [params.grammar_name] - The name of a grammar that is to be used with the recognition request. If
    * you specify a grammar, you must also use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the
    * custom language model for which the grammar is defined. The service recognizes only strings that are recognized by
    * the specified grammar; it does not recognize other custom words from the model's words resource. See
    * [Grammars](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#grammars-input).
    * @param {boolean} [params.redaction] - If `true`, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from final
    * transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with
    * an `X` character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, the
    * service performs no redaction.
    *
    * When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly
    * disable that feature. To ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the
    * `keywords` and `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns only a single final transcript (forces the
    * `max_alternatives` parameter to be `1`).
    *
    * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Korean transcription only.
    *
    * See [Numeric redaction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#redaction).
    * @param {string} [params.content_type] - The format (MIME type) of the audio. For more information about specifying
    * an audio format, see **Audio formats (content types)** in the method description.
    * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom request headers

  /**
    * Recognize audio.
    *
    * Sends audio and returns transcription results for a recognition request. You can pass a maximum of 100 MB and a
    * minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The service automatically detects the endianness of the incoming
    * audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during transcoding.
    * The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use the WebSocket API.
    *
    * **See also:** [Making a basic HTTP
    * request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-basic).
    *
    * ### Streaming mode
    *
    *  For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
    * `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the service closes the connection (status code 408) if it does
    * not receive at least 15 seconds of audio (including silence) in any 30-second period. The service also closes the
    * connection (status code 400) if it detects no speech for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of streaming audio; use the
    * `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
    *
    * **See also:**
    * * [Audio transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
    * * [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts)
    *
    * ### Audio formats (content types)
    *
    *  The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
    * * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
    * format of the audio.
    * * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
    * header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
    * either `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
    *
    * Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
    * of channels and the endianness of the audio.
    * * `audio/alaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
    * * `audio/flac`
    * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
    * * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
    * and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/mp3`
    * * `audio/mpeg`
    * * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
    * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
    * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
    * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
    * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
    * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
    *
    * The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the recognition request: for broadband
    * models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than
    * the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the
    * audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request fails.
    *
    *  **See also:** [Audio formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
    *
    * ### Multipart speech recognition
    *
    *  **Note:** The Watson SDKs do not support multipart speech recognition.
    *
    * The HTTP `POST` method of the service also supports multipart speech recognition. With multipart requests, you pass
    * all audio data as multipart form data. You specify some parameters as request headers and query parameters, but you
    * pass JSON metadata as form data to control most aspects of the transcription.
    *
    * The multipart approach is intended for use with browsers for which JavaScript is disabled or when the parameters
    * used with the request are greater than the 8 KB limit imposed by most HTTP servers and proxies. You can encounter
    * this limit, for example, if you want to spot a very large number of keywords.
    *
    * **See also:** [Making a multipart HTTP
    * request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-multi).
    *
    * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
    * @param {NodeJS.ReadableStream|FileObject|Buffer} params.audio - The audio to transcribe.
    * @param {string} [params.model] - The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request. See
    * [Languages and models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/models.html).
    * @param {string} [params.language_customization_id] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is
    * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model
    * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
    * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Custom
    * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom-input).
    *
    * **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id` parameter.
    * @param {string} [params.acoustic_customization_id] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is
    * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model
    * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
    * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Custom
    * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom-input).
    * @param {string} [params.base_model_version] - The version of the specified base model that is to be used with
    * recognition request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements.
    * The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
    * default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Base model
    * version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
    * @param {number} [params.customization_weight] - If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language
    * model with the recognition request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words
    * from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.
    *
    * Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model
    * when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was
    * specified when the custom model was trained.
    *
    * The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of
    * OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of
    * phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
    *
    * See [Custom models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#custom-input).
    * @param {number} [params.inactivity_timeout] - The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is
    * detected in streaming audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio
    * submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See [Inactivity
    * timeout](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts-inactivity).
    * @param {string[]} [params.keywords] - An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can
    * include one or more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If
    * you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit
    * the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords. See [Keyword
    * spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
    * @param {number} [params.keywords_threshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A
    * word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a
    * probability between 0.0 and 1.0. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. The
    * service performs no keyword spotting if you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
    * spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#keyword_spotting).
    * @param {number} [params.max_alternatives] - The maximum number of alternative transcripts that the service is to
    * return. By default, the service returns a single transcript. If you specify a value of `0`, the service uses the
    * default value, `1`. See [Maximum
    * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#max_alternatives).
    * @param {number} [params.word_alternatives_threshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a
    * hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered
    * if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. By default,
    * the service computes no alternative words. See [Word
    * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_alternatives).
    * @param {boolean} [params.word_confidence] - If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure in the range of 0.0
    * to 1.0 for each word. By default, the service returns no word confidence scores. See [Word
    * confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_confidence).
    * @param {boolean} [params.timestamps] - If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no
    * timestamps are returned. See [Word
    * timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#word_timestamps).
    * @param {boolean} [params.profanity_filter] - If `true`, the service filters profanity from all output except for
    * keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return
    * results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
    * filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#profanity_filter).
    * @param {boolean} [params.smart_formatting] - If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and
    * numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in
    * the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to
    * punctuation symbols. By default, the service performs no smart formatting.
    *
    * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
    *
    * See [Smart formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#smart_formatting).
    * @param {boolean} [params.speaker_labels] - If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were
    * spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, the service returns no speaker labels. Setting
    * `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify
    * `false` for the parameter.
    *
    * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only. To determine whether a language model
    * supports speaker labels, you can also use the **Get a model** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels`
    * is set to `true`.
    *
    * See [Speaker labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
    * @param {string} [params.customization_id] - **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id` parameter to
    * specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request. Do
    * not specify both parameters with a request.
    * @param {string} [params.grammar_name] - The name of a grammar that is to be used with the recognition request. If
    * you specify a grammar, you must also use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the
    * custom language model for which the grammar is defined. The service recognizes only strings that are recognized by
    * the specified grammar; it does not recognize other custom words from the model's words resource. See
    * [Grammars](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#grammars-input).
    * @param {boolean} [params.redaction] - If `true`, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from final
    * transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with
    * an `X` character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, the
    * service performs no redaction.
    *
    * When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly
    * disable that feature. To ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the
    * `keywords` and `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns only a single final transcript (forces the
    * `max_alternatives` parameter to be `1`).
    *
    * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Korean transcription only.
    *
    * See [Numeric redaction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#redaction).
    * @param {string} [params.content_type] - The format (MIME type) of the audio. For more information about specifying
    * an audio format, see **Audio formats (content types)** in the method description.
    * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom request headers
    * @param {Function} [callback] - The callback that handles the response.

  /**
    * Register a callback.
    *
    * Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous recognition requests. The service
    * attempts to register, or white-list, the callback URL if it is not already registered by sending a `GET` request to
    * the callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the `challenge_string` parameter of
    * the request. The request includes an `Accept` header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.
    *
    * To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request from the service. The response
    * must send status code 200 and must include the challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header
    * to `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original registration request with
    * response code 201.
    *
    * The service sends only a single `GET` request to the callback URL. If the service does not receive a reply with a
    * response code of 200 and a body that echoes the challenge string sent by the service within five seconds, it does
    * not white-list the URL; it instead sends status code 400 in response to the **Register a callback** request. If the
    * requested callback URL is already white-listed, the service responds to the initial registration request with
    * response code 200.
    *
    * If you specify a user secret with the request, the service uses it as a key to calculate an HMAC-SHA1 signature of
    * the challenge string in its response to the `POST` request. It sends this signature in the `X-Callback-Signature`
    * header of its `GET` request to the URL during registration. It also uses the secret to calculate a signature over
    * the payload of every callback notification that uses the URL. The signature provides authentication and data
    * integrity for HTTP communications.
    *
    * After you successfully register a callback URL, you can use it with an indefinite number of recognition requests.

    *
    * The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes or hours to complete depending on the
    * total amount of audio data on which the custom acoustic model is being trained and the current load on the service.
    * Typically, training a custom acoustic model takes approximately two to four times the length of its audio data. The
    * range of time depends on the model being trained and the nature of the audio, such as whether the audio is clean or
    * noisy. The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to indicate that the training process has begun.
    *
    * You can monitor the status of the training by using the **Get a custom acoustic model** method to poll the model's
    * status. Use a loop to check the status once a minute. The method returns an `AcousticModel` object that includes
    * `status` and `progress` fields. A status of `available` indicates that the custom model is trained and ready to
    * use. The service cannot accept subsequent training requests, or requests to add new audio resources, until the
    * existing request completes.
    *
    * You can use the optional `custom_language_model_id` parameter to specify the GUID of a separately created custom

  /**
    * Train a custom language model.
    *
    * Initiates the training of a custom language model with new resources such as corpora, grammars, and custom words.
    * After adding, modifying, or deleting resources for a custom language model, use this method to begin the actual
    * training of the model on the latest data. You can specify whether the custom language model is to be trained with
    * all words from its words resource or only with words that were added or modified by the user directly. You must use
    * credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to train it.
    *
    * The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes to complete depending on the amount of
    * data on which the service is being trained and the current load on the service. The method returns an HTTP 200
    * response code to indicate that the training process has begun.
    *
    * You can monitor the status of the training by using the **Get a custom language model** method to poll the model's
    * status. Use a loop to check the status every 10 seconds. The method returns a `LanguageModel` object that includes
    * `status` and `progress` fields. A status of `available` means that the custom model is trained and ready to use.
    * The service cannot accept subsequent training requests or requests to add new resources until the existing request
    * completes.
    *
    * Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
    * * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as another training request or a
    * request to add a corpus or grammar to the model.
    * * No training data have been added to the custom model.
    * * One or more words that were added to the custom model have invalid sounds-like pronunciations that you must fix.
    *
    * **See also:** [Train the custom language
    * model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-create.html#trainModel-language).
    *
    * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
    * @param {string} params.customization_id - The customization ID (GUID) of the custom language model that is to be
    * used for the request. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the
    * custom model.
    * @param {string} [params.word_type_to_add] - The type of words from the custom language model's words resource on
    * which to train the model:
    * * `all` (the default) trains the model on all new words, regardless of whether they were extracted from corpora or
    * grammars or were added or modified by the user.
    * * `user` trains the model only on new words that were added or modified by the user directly. The model is not
    * trained on new words extracted from corpora or grammars.
    * @param {number} [params.customization_weight] - Specifies a customization weight for the custom language model. The
    * customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to
    * those from the base model for speech recognition. Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0; the default is 0.3.
    *
    * The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of
    * OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of
    * phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
    *
    * The value that you assign is used for all recognition requests that use the model. You can override it for any
    * recognition request by specifying a customization weight for that request.
    * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom request headers
    * @param {Function} [callback] - The callback that handles the response.

    * the custom model and the current load on the service; typically, upgrade takes approximately twice the length of
    * the total audio contained in the custom model. A custom model must be in the `ready` or `available` state to be

    * The method returns an `AcousticModel` object that includes `status` and `progress` fields. Use a loop to check the
    * status once a minute. While it is being upgraded, the custom model has the status `upgrading`. When the upgrade is
    * complete, the model resumes the status that it had prior to upgrade. The service cannot accept subsequent requests

    * @param {boolean} [params.force] - If `true`, forces the upgrade of a custom acoustic model for which no input data
    * has been modified since it was last trained. Use this parameter only to force the upgrade of a custom acoustic
    * model that is trained with a custom language model, and only if you receive a 400 response code and the message `No
