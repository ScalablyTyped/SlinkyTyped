/**
  * The IBM&reg; Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-recognition capabilities to produce transcripts of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. In addition to basic transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For most languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON response content in the UTF-8 character set.   For speech recognition, the service supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication channel: Clients send requests and audio to the service and receive results over a single connection asynchronously.   The service also offers two customization interfaces. Use language model customization to expand the vocabulary of a base model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model customization to adapt a base model for the acoustic characteristics of your audio. For language model customization, the service also supports grammars. A grammar is a formal language specification that lets you restrict the phrases that the service can recognize.   Language model customization is generally available for production use with most supported languages. Acoustic model customization is beta functionality that is available for all supported languages.

    * Construct a SpeechToTextV1 object.

    * @param {Object} options - Options for the service.
    * @param {string} [options.url] - The base url to use when contacting the service (e.g. 'https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api'). The base url may differ between Bluemix regions.
    * @param {string} [options.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
    * @param {string} [options.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
    * @param {string} [options.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
    * @param {string} [options.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
    * @param {string} [options.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
    * @param {boolean} [options.use_unauthenticated] - Set to `true` to avoid including an authorization header. This option may be useful for requests that are proxied.
    * @param {Object} [options.headers] - Default headers that shall be included with every request to the service.
    * @param {boolean} [options.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out] - Set to `true` to opt-out of data collection. By default, all IBM Watson services log requests and their results. Logging is done only to improve the services for future users. The logged data is not shared or made public. If you are concerned with protecting the privacy of users' personal information or otherwise do not want your requests to be logged, you can opt out of logging.
