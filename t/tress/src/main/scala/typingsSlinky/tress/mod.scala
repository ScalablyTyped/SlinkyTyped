  /**
    * Creates queue object that will store jobs and process them with worker function
    * in parallel (up to the concurrency limit)
    * @param worker An asynchronous function for processing a queued job,
    * which must call its done argument when finished.
    * Callback done may take various argumens,
    * but first argument must be error (if job failed),
    * null/undefined (if job successfully finished)
    * or boolean (if job returned to queue head (if true)
    * or to queue tail (if false))
    * @param concurrency An integer for determining how many worker functions
    * should be run in parallel. If omitted, the concurrency defaults to 1.
    * If negative - no parallel and delay between worker functions (concurrency -1,000 sets 1 second delay)
