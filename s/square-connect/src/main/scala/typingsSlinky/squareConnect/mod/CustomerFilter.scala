    * customers in Groups `A` or `B` or ... of the list. With the `all` option, the search returns customers in Groups
    * `1` and `2` and ... of the list. With the `none` option, the search returns customers not in Groups `i` and not
    * in `ii` and not in ... of the list. If any of the search conditions are not met, including when an invalid or
    * non-existent group ID is provided, the result is an empty list. You can use the `group_ids` search filter with
    * other available filters. You cannot use the `group_ids` filter to select customers based on segment membership.

    * A filter to [select customers by their phone numbers](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/customers-api/cookbook/search-customers#search-by-phone-number) visible to the seller.
    * This filter is case insensitive. For [exact matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/customers-api/cookbook/search-customers#exact-search-by-phone-number),
    * this filter causes the search to return customers whose phone number matches the specified query expression.
    * The number in the query must be of an E.164-compliant form. In particular, it must include the leading `+`
    * sign followed by a contry code and then a subscriber number. The standard E.614 form of a US phone number is
    * `+12061112222` of the domestic version or `+0012061112222` of the international version. The E.164-compliant variations
    * include `+1 (206) 111-2222` or `+001 (206) 111-2222`, respectively. To match the query expression, stored customers'
    * phone numbers are converted to the standard E.164 form of the national and internationalized versions.
    * For [fuzzy matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/customers-api/cookbook/search-customers#fuzzy-search-by-phone-number),
    * this filter causes the search to return customers whose phone number matches partially the token or tokens
    * provided in the query expression. For example, if the search query contains `415-123-45`, the filter selects those
    * customers with phone numbers of `415-123-4567` or `234-151-2345`. The search does not return customers with the
    * phone number of `415-123-4678`. Similarly, if the search query contains `415` as part of the phone number, the
    * search returns those customers with phone numbers of `(415)-123-4567`, `(123) 415-1567`, and `1 (415) 123-4567`.

    * of a customer's reference ID against a query's reference ID is evaluated as exact match between two strings,
    * character by character in the given order. [Fuzzy matching](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/customers-api/cookbook/search-customers#fuzzy-search-by-reference-id)
    * of stored reference IDs against queried reference IDs works  exactly the same as fuzzy matching on email addresses.
    * Non-alphanumeric characters  are replaced by spaces to tokenize stored and queried reference IDs.
    * A match is found if a tokenized stored reference ID contains all tokens specified in any order in the query.
    * For example, a query of `NYC M` will match customer profiles with the `reference_id` value of `NYC_M_35_JOHNSON` and `NYC_27_MURRAY`.
