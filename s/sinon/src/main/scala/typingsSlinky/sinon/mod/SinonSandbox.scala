    * * config.toFake - String[ ] - an array with explicit function names to fake.

    * * config.shouldAdvanceTime - Boolean - tells lolex to increment mocked time automatically based on the real system time shift (default: false)
    * * Please visit the lolex.install documentation for the full feature set.
    * * Important note: when faking nextTick, normal calls to process.nextTick() would not execute automatically as they would during normal event-loop phases.
