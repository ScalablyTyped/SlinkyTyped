    * `verifyDelta()` will return the delta between the counter value of the token
    * and the given counter value. For example, if given a counter 5 and a window
    * 10, `verifyDelta()` will look at tokens from 5 to 15, inclusive. If it finds
    * it at counter position 7, it will return `{ delta: 2 }`.

    * @return On success, returns an object with the counter
    *   difference between the client and the server as the `delta` property (i.e.
    *   `{ delta: 0 }`).
