    * will have a delta of 0.

    * You can specify a window to add more leeway to the verification process.
    * Setting the window param will check for the token at the given counter value
    * as well as `window` tokens ahead and `window` tokens behind (two-sided
    * window). See param for more info.
    *
    * `verifyDelta()` will return the delta between the counter value of the token
    * and the given counter value. For example, if given a time at counter 1000 and
    * a window of 5, `verifyDelta()` will look at tokens from 995 to 1005,
    * inclusive. In other words, if the time-step is 30 seconds, it will look at
    * tokens from 2.5 minutes ago to 2.5 minutes in the future, inclusive.
    * If it finds it at counter position 1002, it will return `{ delta: 2 }`.
    * If it finds it at counter position 997, it will return `{ delta: -3 }`.
    *
    * @return On success, returns an object with the time step
    *   difference between the client and the server as the `delta` property (e.g.
    *   `{ delta: 0 }`).
