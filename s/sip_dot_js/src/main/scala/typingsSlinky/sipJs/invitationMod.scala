      * reliable provisional responses (100rel in Require header),
      * otherwise it is true. The provisional is sent by calling
      * `progress()` without any options.
      *
      * FIXME: TODO: It seems reasonable that the ISC user should
      * be able to optionally disable this behavior. As the provisional
      * is sent prior to the "invite" event being emitted, it's a known
      * issue that the ISC user cannot register listeners or do any other
      * setup prior to the call to `progress()`. As an example why this is
      * an issue, setting `ua.configuration.rel100` to REQUIRED will result
      * in an attempt by `progress()` to send a 183 with SDP produced by
      * calling `getDescription()` on a session description handler, but
      * the ISC user cannot perform any potentially required session description
      * handler initialization (thus preventing the utilization of setting
      * `ua.configuration.rel100` to REQUIRED). That begs the question of
      * why this behavior is disabled when the UAC requires 100rel but not
      * when the UAS requires 100rel? But ignoring that, it's just one example
      * of a class of cases where the ISC user needs to do something prior
      * to the first call to `progress()` and is unable to do so.
