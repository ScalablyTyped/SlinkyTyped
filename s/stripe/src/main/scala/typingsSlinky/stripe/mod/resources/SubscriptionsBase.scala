  /**
    * Cancels a customer's subscription. If you set the at_period_end parameter to true, the subscription will remain active until
    * the end of the period, at which point it will be canceled and not renewed. By default, the subscription is terminated
    * immediately. In either case, the customer will not be charged again for the subscription. Note, however, that any pending
    * invoice items that you've created will still be charged for at the end of the period unless manually deleted. If you've set
    * the subscription to cancel at period end, any pending prorations will also be left in place and collected at the end of the
    * period, but if the subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be removed. By default, all unpaid
    * invoices for the customer will be closed upon subscription cancellation. We do this in order to prevent unexpected payment
    * retries once the customer has canceled a subscription. However, you can reopen the invoices manually after subscription
    * cancellation to have us proceed with automatic retries, or you could even re-attempt payment yourself on all unpaid invoices
    * before allowing the customer to cancel the subscription at all.
    *
    * @returns The canceled subscription object. Its subscription status will be set to "canceled" unless you've set at_period_end
    * to true when canceling, in which case the status will remain "active" but the cancel_at_period_end attribute will change to true.
    *
    * @param subscriptionId The ID of the subscription to cancel.
    * @param data Specify when to cancel the subscription

  /**
    * Updates an existing subscription on a customer to match the specified parameters. When changing plans or quantities,

    *
    * By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a $10 plan, she'll be billed
    * $10 immediately. If she then switches to a $20 plan on May 15, on June 1 she'll be billed $25 ($20 for a renewal of her
    * subscription and a $5 prorating adjustment for the previous month). Similarly, a downgrade will generate a credit to be
    * applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes. Switching plans does not change the billing
    * date or generate an immediate charge unless you're switching between different intervals (e.g. monthly to yearly), in which
    * case we apply a credit for the time unused on the old plan and charge for the new plan starting right away, resetting the
    * billing date. (Note that if we charge for the new plan, and that payment fails, the plan change will not go into effect). If
    * you'd like to charge for an upgrade immediately, just pass prorate as true as usual, and then invoice the customer as soon
    * as you make the subscription change. That'll collect the proration adjustments into a new invoice, and Stripe will automatically
    * attempt to pay the invoice. If you don't want to prorate at all, set the prorate option to false and the customer would be billed
    * $10 on May 1 and $20 on June 1. Similarly, if you set prorate to false when switching between different billing intervals
    * (monthly to yearly, for example), we won't generate any credits for the old subscription's unused time, although we will still
    * reset the billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription.
    *
    * @returns The newly updated subscription object if the call succeeded. If a charge is required for the update, and
    * the charge fails, this call raises throws an error, and the subscription update does not go into effect.
