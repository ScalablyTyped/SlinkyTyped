/**
  * Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request.
  * In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that
  * resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, a charge failed, etc.),
  * and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Stripe's servers. Not all errors map cleanly onto HTTP
  * response codes, however. When a request is valid but does not complete successfully (e.g. a card is
  * declined), we return a 402 error code.
  *
  * 200 - OK                           Everything worked as expected.
  * 400 - Bad Request                  Often missing a required parameter.
  * 401 - Unauthorized                 No valid API key provided.
  * 402 - Request Failed               Parameters were valid but request failed.
  * 404 - Not Found                    The requested item doesn't exist.
  * 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors Something went wrong on Stripe's end.
