    * Ensures that the Office JavaScript APIs are ready to be called by the add-in. If the framework hasn't initialized yet, the callback or promise 
    * will wait until the Office host is ready to accept API calls. Note that though this API is intended to be used inside an Office add-in, it can 
    * also be used outside the add-in. In that case, once Office.js determines that it is running outside of an Office host application, it will call 
    * the callback and resolve the promise with "null" for both the host and platform.
    * 
    * @param callback - An optional callback method, that will receive the host and platform info. 
    *                   Alternatively, rather than use a callback, an add-in may simply wait for the Promise returned by the function to resolve.
    * @returns A Promise that contains the host and platform info, once initialization is completed.
