  * **Hosts**: Excel, PowerPoint, Word
  * 
  * The settings created by using the methods of the Settings object are saved per add-in and per document. 
  * That is, they are available only to the add-in that created them, and only from the document in which they are saved.
  *
  * The name of a setting is a string, while the value can be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array.
  *
  * The Settings object is automatically loaded as part of the Document object, and is available by calling the settings property of that object 
  * when the add-in is activated. 
  * 
  * The developer is responsible for calling the saveAsync method after adding or deleting settings to save the settings in the document.
