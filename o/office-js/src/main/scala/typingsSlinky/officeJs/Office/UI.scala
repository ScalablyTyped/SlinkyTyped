    * The initial page must be on the same domain as the parent page (the startAddress parameter). After the initial page loads, you can go to 
    * other domains.
    *
    * Any page calling `Office.context.ui.messageParent` must also be on the same domain as the parent page.
    *
    * **Design considerations**:
    *
    * The following design considerations apply to dialog boxes:
    *
    * - An Office Add-in task pane can have only one dialog box open at any time. Multiple dialogs can be open at the same time from Add-in 
    * Commands (custom ribbon buttons or menu items).
    *
    * - Every dialog box can be moved and resized by the user.
    *
    * - Every dialog box is centered on the screen when opened.
    *
    * - Dialog boxes appear on top of the host application and in the order in which they were created.
    *
    * Use a dialog box to:
    *
    * - Display authentication pages to collect user credentials.
    *
    * - Display an error/progress/input screen from a ShowTaskpane or ExecuteAction command.
    *
    * - Temporarily increase the surface area that a user has available to complete a task.
    *
    * Do not use a dialog box to interact with a document. Use a task pane instead.
    * 
    * **displayDialogAsync Errors**:

    *     <th>Code number</th>
