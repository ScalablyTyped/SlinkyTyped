  /**
    * Adds a custom transition to the NavContainer type (not to a particular instance!). The transition is
    * identified by a "name". Make sure to only use names that will not collide with transitions which may
    * be added to the NavContainer later. A suggestion is to use the prefix "c_" or "_" for your custom
    * transitions to ensure this."to" and "back" are the transition functions for the forward and backward
    * navigation.Both will be called with the following parameters:- oFromPage: the Control which is
    * currently being displayed by the NavContainer- oToPage: the Control which should be displayed by the
    * NavContainer after the transition- fCallback: a function which MUST be called when the transition
    * has completed- oTransitionParameters: a data object that can be given by application code when
    * triggering the transition by calling to() or back(); this object could give additional information
    * to the transition function, like the DOM element which triggered the transition or the desired
    * transition durationThe contract for "to" and "back" is that they may do an animation of their
    * choice, but it should not take "too long". At the beginning of the transition the target page
    * "oToPage" does have the CSS class "sapMNavItemHidden" which initially hides the target page
    * (visibility:hidden). The transition can do any preparation (e.g. move that page out of the screen or
    * make it transparent) and then should remove this CSS class.After the animation the target page
    * "oToPage" should cover the entire screen and the source page "oFromPage" should not be visible
    * anymore. This page should then have the CSS class "sapMNavItemHidden".For adding/removing this or
    * other CSS classes, the transition can use the addStyleClass/removeStyleClass
    * method:oFromPage.addStyleClass("sapMNavItemHidden");When the transition is complete, it MUST call
    * the given fCallback method to inform the NavContainer that navigation has finished!Hint: if the
    * target page of your transition stays black on iPhone, try wrapping the animation start into
    * asetTimeout(..., 0)block (delayed, but without waiting).This method can be called on any
    * NavContainer instance or statically on the sap.m.NavContainer type. However, the transition will
    * always be registered for the type (and ALL instances), not for the single instance on which this
    * method was invoked.Returns the sap.m.NavContainer type if called statically, or "this" (to allow
    * method chaining) if called on a particular NavContainer instance.
    * @param sName The name of the transition. This name can be used by the application to choose this
    * transition when navigating "to()" or "back()": the "transitionName" parameter of "NavContainer.to()"
    * corresponds to this name, the back() navigation will automatically use the same transition.       
    * Make sure to only use names that will not collide with transitions which may be added to the
    * NavContainer later. A suggestion is to use the prefix "c_" or "_" for your custom transitions to
    * ensure this.
    * @param oTo The function which will be called by the NavContainer when the application navigates
    * "to()", using this animation's name. The NavContainer instance is the "this" context within the
    * animation function.        See the documentation of NavContainer.addCustomTransitions for more
    * details about this function.
    * @param oBack The function which will be called by the NavContainer when the application navigates
    * "back()" from a page where it had navigated to using this animation's name. The NavContainer
    * instance is the "this" context within the animation function.        See the documentation of
    * NavContainer.addCustomTransitions for more details about this function.

    * be done BEFORE calling to(), in order to avoid unwanted side effects, e.g. related to the page
    * animation.Available transitions currently include "slide" (default), "fade", "flip", and "show".
    * None of these is currently making use of any given transitionParameters.Calling this navigation
    * method triggers first the (cancelable) "navigate" event on the NavContainer, then the "beforeHide"
    * pseudo event on the source page and "beforeFirstShow" (if applicable) and"beforeShow" on the target
    * page. Later - after the transition has completed - the "afterShow" pseudo event is triggered on the
    * target page and "afterHide" on the page which has been left. The given data object is available in
    * the "beforeFirstShow", "beforeShow" and "afterShow" event object as "data" property.
    * @param sPageId The screen to which drilldown should happen. The ID or the control itself can be
    * given.
    * @param sTransitionName The type of the transition/animation to apply. This parameter can be omitted;
    * then the default is "slide" (horizontal movement from the right).        Other options are: "fade",
    * "flip", and "show" and the names of any registered custom transitions.        None of the standard
    * transitions is currently making use of any given transition parameters.
    * @param oData Since version 1.7.1. This optional object can carry any payload data which should be
    * made available to the target page. The "beforeShow" event on the target page will contain this data
    * object as "data" property.        Use case: in scenarios where the entity triggering the navigation
    * can or should not directly initialize the target page, it can fill this object and the target page
    * itself (or a listener on it) can take over the initialization, using the given data.        When the
    * "transitionParameters" object is used, this "data" object must also be given (either as object or as
    * null) in order to have a proper parameter order.
    * @param oTransitionParameters Since version 1.7.1. This optional object can contain additional
    * information for the transition function, like the DOM element which triggered the transition or the
    * desired transition duration.        For a proper parameter order, the "data" parameter must be given
    * when the "transitionParameters" parameter is used. (it can be given as "null")        NOTE: it
    * depends on the transition function how the object should be structured and which parameters are
    * actually used to influence the transition.        The "show", "slide" and "fade" transitions do not
    * use any parameter.
