    * Searches for query terms inside of a file. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).
    *
    * When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).
    *
    * For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:
    *
    * `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`
    *
    * This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.
    *
    * #### Considerations for code search
    *
    * Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
    *
    * *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
    * *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
    * *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing
    * language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.
