    *    the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
    *    fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
    *    should be returned since the client should not retry unless
    *    they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
    *  - Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
    *    REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
    *    server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
    *    read-modify-write on the same resource.
