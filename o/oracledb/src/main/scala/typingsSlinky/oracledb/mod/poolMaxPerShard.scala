/**
  * The maximum number of connections per shard for connection pools. This ensures that the pool is balanced towards each shard.
  * 
  * This property may be overridden when creating a connection pool.
  * 
  * When this property is set, and a new connection request would cause the number of connections to the target shard to exceed the limit,
  * then that new connection request will block until a suitable connection has been released back to the pool.
  * Importantly, when blocked, the queueTimeout value will be ignored and the pending connection request will consume one worker thread.
  * 
  * @since 4.1
