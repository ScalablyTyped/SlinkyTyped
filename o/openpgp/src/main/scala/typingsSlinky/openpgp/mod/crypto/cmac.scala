    * We have made a small modification to the OMAC algorithm as it was
    * originally presented, changing one of its two constants.
    * Specifically, the constant 4 at line 85 was the constant 1/2 (the
    * multiplicative inverse of 2) in the original definition of OMAC [14].
    * The OMAC authors indicate that they will promulgate this modification
    * [15], which slightly simplifies implementations.
