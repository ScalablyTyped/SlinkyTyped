/**
  * @classdesc
  * A control is a visible widget with a DOM element in a fixed position on the
  * screen. They can involve user input (buttons), or be informational only;
  * the position is determined using CSS. By default these are placed in the
  * container with CSS class name `ol-overlaycontainer-stopevent`, but can use
  * any outside DOM element.
  *
  * This is the base class for controls. You can use it for simple custom
  * controls by creating the element with listeners, creating an instance:
  * ```js
  * var myControl = new ol.control.Control({element: myElement});
  * ```
  * and then adding this to the map.
  *
  * The main advantage of having this as a control rather than a simple separate
  * DOM element is that preventing propagation is handled for you. Controls
  * will also be `ol.Object`s in a `ol.Collection`, so you can use their
  * methods.
  *
  * You can also extend this base for your own control class. See
  * examples/custom-controls for an example of how to do this.
  *
  * @param options Control options.
