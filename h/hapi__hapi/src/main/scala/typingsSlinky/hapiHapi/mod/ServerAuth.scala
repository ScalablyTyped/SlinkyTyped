    * configured (contains the strategy or strategies authentication settings). Otherwise, the route authentication

    * config will have no impact on the routes added prior. However, the default will apply to routes added
    * before server.auth.default() is called if those routes lack any authentication config.
    * The default auth strategy configuration can be accessed via server.auth.settings.default. To obtain the active
    * authentication configuration of a route, use server.auth.lookup(request.route).
