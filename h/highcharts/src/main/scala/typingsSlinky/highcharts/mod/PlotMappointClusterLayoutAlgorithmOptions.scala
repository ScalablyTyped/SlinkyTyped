  /**
    * (Highcharts, Highmaps) Type of the algorithm used to combine points into
    * a cluster. There are three available algorithms:
    *
    * 1) `grid` - grid-based clustering technique. Points are assigned to
    * squares of set size depending on their position on the plot area. Points
    * inside the grid square are combined into a cluster. The grid size can be
    * controlled by `gridSize` property (grid size changes at certain zoom
    * levels).
    *
    * 2) `kmeans` - based on K-Means clustering technique. In the first step,
    * points are divided using the grid method (distance property is a grid
    * size) to find the initial amount of clusters. Next, each point is
    * classified by computing the distance between each cluster center and that
    * point. When the closest cluster distance is lower than distance property
    * set by a user the point is added to this cluster otherwise is classified
    * as `noise`. The algorithm is repeated until each cluster center not
    * change its previous position more than one pixel. This technique is more
    * accurate but also more time consuming than the `grid` algorithm,
    * especially for big datasets.
    *
    * 3) `optimizedKmeans` - based on K-Means clustering technique. This
    * algorithm uses k-means algorithm only on the chart initialization or when
    * chart extremes have greater range than on initialization. When a chart is
    * redrawn the algorithm checks only clustered points distance from the
    * cluster center and rebuild it when the point is spaced enough to be
    * outside the cluster. It provides performance improvement and more stable
    * clusters position yet can be used rather on small and sparse datasets.
    *
    * By default, the algorithm depends on visible quantity of points and
    * `kmeansThreshold`. When there are more visible points than the
    * `kmeansThreshold` the `grid` algorithm is used, otherwise `kmeans`.
    *
    * The custom clustering algorithm can be added by assigning a callback
    * function as the type property. This function takes an array of
    * `processedXData`, `processedYData`, `processedXData` indexes and
    * `layoutAlgorithm` options as arguments and should return an object with
    * grouped data.
    *
    * The algorithm should return an object like that: (see online
    * documentation for example)
    *
    * `clusterId` (example above - unique id of a cluster or noise) is an array
    * of points belonging to a cluster. If the array has only one point or
    * fewer points than set in `cluster.minimumClusterSize` it won't be
    * combined into a cluster.
