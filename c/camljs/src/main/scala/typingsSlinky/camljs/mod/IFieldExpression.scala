    NOTICE: DateRangesOverlap with overlapType other than Now cannot be used with SP.CamlQuery, because it doesn't support
    CalendarDate and ExpandRecurrence query options. Lists.asmx, however, supports them, so you can still use DateRangesOverlap
    with SPServices.
    @param overlapType Defines type of overlap: return all events for a day, for a week, for a month or for a year
    @param calendarDate Defines date that will be used for determining events for which exactly day/week/month/year will be returned.
    This value is ignored for overlapType=Now, but for the other overlap types it is mandatory.
    @param eventDateField Internal name of "Start Time" field (default: "EventDate" - all OOTB Calendar lists use this name)
    @param endDateField Internal name of "End Time" field (default: "EndDate" - all OOTB Calendar lists use this name)
    @param recurrenceIDField Internal name of "Recurrence ID" field (default: "RecurrenceID" - all OOTB Calendar lists use this name)
