    * A successful verification by the Verified Access Web API is a strong signal of all of the following:
    *  - The current device is a legitimate Chrome OS device.
    *  - The current device is managed by the domain specified during verification.

    *  - The current device state complies with enterprise device policy.
    * For example, a policy may specify that the device must not be in developer mode.
    *  - Any device identity emitted by the verification is tightly bound to the hardware of the current device.
    *    This function is highly restricted and will fail if the current device is not managed,
    *    the current user is not managed, or if this operation has not explicitly been enabled
    *    for the caller by enterprise device policy. The Enterprise Machine Key does not reside
