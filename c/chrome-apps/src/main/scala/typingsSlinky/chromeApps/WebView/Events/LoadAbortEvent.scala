  * Fired when a top-level load has aborted without committing.

  * **Note:**
  * When a resource load is aborted, a loadabort event will eventually be followed by a loadstop event,
  * even if all committed loads since the last loadstop event (if any) were aborted.
  *
  * **Note:**
  * When the load of either an about URL or a JavaScript URL is aborted,
  * loadabort will be fired and then the webview will be navigated to 'about:blank'.
