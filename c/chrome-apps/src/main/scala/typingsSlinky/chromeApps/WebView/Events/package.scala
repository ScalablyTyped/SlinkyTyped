    * but does not include asynchronous resource loads.
    *
    * This event fires every time the number of document-level loads transitions from one (or more) to zero.
    * For example, if a page that has already finished loading (i.e., loadstop already fired once) creates
    * a new iframe which loads a page, then a second loadstop will fire when the iframe page load completes.
    *
    * This pattern is commonly observed on pages that load ads.
    *
    * **Note:**
    * When a committed load is aborted, a loadstop event will eventually follow a loadabort event,
    * even if all committed loads since the last loadstop event (if any) were aborted.
