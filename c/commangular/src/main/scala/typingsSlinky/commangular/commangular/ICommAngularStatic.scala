    * This function allows you to hijack the execution before or after and

    * see http://commangular.org/docs/#command-aspects
    * @param aspectDescriptor The interceptor descriptor has two parts 'Where' and 'What'.
    *         Where do you want to intercept? you've 5 options :
    *         - @Before : The interceptor will be executed before the command. You will be able to
    *                 cancel the command or modify the data that will be injected in the command or do
    *                 some other operation you need before the command execution.
    *         - @After : The interceptor will be executed just after the command and before any other next
    *                 command. You can get the lastResult from the command, cancel execution etc etc.
    *         - @AfterExecution : This intercetor is executed just after the command execute method and
    *                 it can get the result from the command and update it before the onResult method is executed.
    *         - @AfterThrowing : This interceptor will be executed if the command or any interceptor of
    *                 the command throws an exception. You can get the error throwed injected to do what you need.
    *         - @Around : The interceptor is executed around a command.That means that a especial
    *                 object 'processor' will be injected in the interceptor and you can invoke the command
    *                 or the next interceptor. It will be better explained below.
    * @param aspectFunction It's the command class execute function that will be run for the given aspect.
    * @param order You can chain any number of interceptors to the same command, so if you need to executed
    *         the interceptor in a specific order you can indicate it here. An order of 0 is assigned by default.
