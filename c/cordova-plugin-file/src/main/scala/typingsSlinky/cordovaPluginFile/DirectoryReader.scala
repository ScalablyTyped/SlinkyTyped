  * This interface lets a user list files and directories in a directory. If there are
  * no additions to or deletions from a directory between the first and last call to
  * readEntries, and no errors occur, then:
  *     A series of calls to readEntries must return each entry in the directory exactly once.
  *     Once all entries have been returned, the next call to readEntries must produce an empty array.
  *     If not all entries have been returned, the array produced by readEntries must not be empty.
  *     The entries produced by readEntries must not include the directory itself ["."] or its parent [".."].
