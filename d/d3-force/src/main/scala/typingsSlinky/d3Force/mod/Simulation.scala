    * likewise, a node with a defined node.fy has node.y reset to this value and node.vy set to zero.
    * To unfix a node that was previously fixed, set node.fx and node.fy to null, or delete these properties.

    * this method must be called again with the new (or changed) array to notify the simulation and bound forces of the change;
