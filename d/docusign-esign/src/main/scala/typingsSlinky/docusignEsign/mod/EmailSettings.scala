    * An array containing the email address that should receive a copy of all email communications related to an envelope for archiving purposes. Maximum Length: 100 characters.

    * While this property is an array, note that it takes only a single email address.

    * **Note**: Only users with the `canManageAccount` setting set to **true** can use this option.

    * DocuSign verifies that the email format is correct, but does not verify that the email address is active. You can use this for archiving purposes. However,
    * using this property overrides the BCC for Email Archive information setting for this envelope.

    * **Example**: if your account has BCC for Email Archive set up for the email address archive@mycompany.com and you send an envelope using the BCC Email
    * Override to send a BCC email to salesarchive@mycompany.com, then a copy of the envelope is only sent to the salesarchive@mycompany.com email address.
