    * such as a mousedown or touchstart, immediately before the drag gesture starts.
    * The subject is then exposed as event.subject on subsequent drag events for this gesture.

    * an object representing the coordinates of the pointer is created.
    * When dragging circle elements in SVG, the default subject is thus the datum of the circle being dragged.
    * With Canvas, the default subject is the canvas elementâ€™s datum (regardless of where on the canvas you click).
    * In this case, a custom subject accessor would be more appropriate,
    * such as one that picks the closest circle to the mouse within a given search radius.
    *
    * The subject of a drag gesture may not be changed after the gesture starts.

    * so that the relative position of the subject and the pointer can be preserved during the drag gesture.
