    * affected if the asset is removed and re-created again.  Possible

    * &quot;ADDED&quot;: indicates that the asset was not present before
    * compare_duration, but present at reference_time. * &quot;REMOVED&quot;:
    * indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration,
    * but not present at reference_time. * &quot;ACTIVE&quot;: indicates that

    * time period defined by              compare_duration and reference_time.
