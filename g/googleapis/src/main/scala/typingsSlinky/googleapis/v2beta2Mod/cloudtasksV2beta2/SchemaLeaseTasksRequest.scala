    * `filter` can be used to specify a subset of tasks to lease.  When
    * `filter` is set to `tag=&lt;my-tag&gt;` then the response will contain
    * only tasks whose tag is equal to `&lt;my-tag&gt;`. `&lt;my-tag&gt;` must
    * be less than 500 characters.  When `filter` is set to
    * `tag_function=oldest_tag()`, only tasks which have the same tag as the
    * task with the oldest schedule_time will be returned.  Grammar Syntax:  *
    * `filter = &quot;tag=&quot; tag | &quot;tag_function=&quot; function`  *
    * `tag = string`  * `function = &quot;oldest_tag()&quot;`  The
    * `oldest_tag()` function returns tasks which have the same tag as the
    * oldest task (ordered by schedule time).  SDK compatibility: Although the
    * SDK allows tags to be either string or
    * [bytes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-byte:A-),
    * only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. Tag which aren&#39;t
    * UTF-8 encoded can&#39;t be used in the filter and the task&#39;s tag will
    * be displayed as empty in Cloud Tasks.
