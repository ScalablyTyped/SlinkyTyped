/**
  * A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step
  * can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test
  * runner execution or an execution of a compiler).  Steps can overlap (for
  * instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are
  * done in parallel).  Here is an example, let&#39;s consider that we have a
  * continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The
  * workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user
  * creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update
  * TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the
  * xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user
  * update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE  A Step can
  * be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes
  * immutable.
