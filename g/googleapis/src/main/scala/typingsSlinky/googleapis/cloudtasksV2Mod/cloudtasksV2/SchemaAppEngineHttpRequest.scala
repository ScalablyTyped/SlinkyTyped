/**
  * App Engine HTTP request.  The message defines the HTTP request that is sent
  * to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched.  This proto can only be
  * used for tasks in a queue which has app_engine_http_queue set.  Using
  * AppEngineHttpRequest requires
  * [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
  * Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope:
  * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`  The task will be
  * delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same project as the
  * queue. For more information, see [How Requests are
  * Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
  * and how routing is affected by [dispatch
  * files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
  * Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
  * Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
  * Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or
  * HTTPS). The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the
  * HTTP protocol.  The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the
  * task is delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level:  * If
  * set,    app_engine_routing_override    is used for all tasks in the queue,
  * no matter what the setting    is for the    task-level app_engine_routing.
  * The `url` that the task will be sent to is:  * `url =` host `+`
  * relative_uri  Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app
  * handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login:
  * admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref).
  * Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs
  * restricted with [`login:
  * required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref)
  * Task dispatches also do not follow redirects.  The task attempt has
  * succeeded if the app&#39;s request handler returns an HTTP response code in
  * the range [`200` - `299`]. `503` is considered an App Engine system error
  * instead of an application error. Requests returning error `503` will be
  * retried regardless of retry configuration and not counted against retry
  * counts. Any other response code or a failure to receive a response before
  * the deadline is a failed attempt.

    * information about the task; see [request
    * headers](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/push/creating-handlers#reading_request_headers).
