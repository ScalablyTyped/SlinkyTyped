/**
  * The description of a dynamic collection of monitored resources. Each group
  * has a filter that is matched against monitored resources and their
  * associated metadata. If a group&#39;s filter matches an available monitored
  * resource, then that resource is a member of that group. Groups can contain
  * any number of monitored resources, and each monitored resource can be a
  * member of any number of groups.Groups can be nested in parent-child
  * hierarchies. The parentName field identifies an optional parent for each
  * group. If a group has a parent, then the only monitored resources available
  * to be matched by the group&#39;s filter are the resources contained in the
  * parent group. In other words, a group contains the monitored resources that
  * match its filter and the filters of all the group&#39;s ancestors. A group
  * without a parent can contain any monitored resource.For example, consider
  * an infrastructure running a set of instances with two user-defined tags:
  * &quot;environment&quot; and &quot;role&quot;. A parent group has a filter,
  * environment=&quot;production&quot;. A child of that parent group has a
  * filter, role=&quot;transcoder&quot;. The parent group contains all
  * instances in the production environment, regardless of their roles. The
  * child group contains instances that have the transcoder role and are in the
  * production environment.The monitored resources contained in a group can
  * change at any moment, depending on what resources exist and what filters
  * are associated with the group and its ancestors.
