    * starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage
    * when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.  The [token
    * bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to
    * control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that
    * holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time
    * a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be
    * dispatched until the queue&#39;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket
    * will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on
    * max_dispatches_per_second.  Cloud Tasks will pick the value of
    * `max_burst_size` based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second.  For
    * App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`,
    * `max_burst_size` is equal to
    * [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).
    * Since `max_burst_size` is output only, if UpdateQueue is called on a
    * queue created by `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based
    * on the value of max_dispatches_per_second, regardless of whether
    * max_dispatches_per_second is updated.
