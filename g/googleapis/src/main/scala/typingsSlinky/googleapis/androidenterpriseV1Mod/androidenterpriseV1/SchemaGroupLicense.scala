/**
  * Group license objects allow you to keep track of licenses (called
  * entitlements) for both free and paid apps. For a free app, a group license
  * is created when an enterprise admin first approves the product in Google
  * Play or when the first entitlement for the product is created for a user
  * via the API. For a paid app, a group license object is only created when an
  * enterprise admin purchases the product in Google Play for the first time.
  * Use the API to query group licenses. A Grouplicenses resource includes the
  * total number of licenses purchased (paid apps only) and the total number of
  * licenses currently in use. In other words, the total number of Entitlements
  * that exist for the product.  Only one group license object is created per
  * product and group license objects are never deleted. If a product is
  * unapproved, its group license remains. This allows enterprise admins to
  * keep track of any remaining entitlements for the product.
