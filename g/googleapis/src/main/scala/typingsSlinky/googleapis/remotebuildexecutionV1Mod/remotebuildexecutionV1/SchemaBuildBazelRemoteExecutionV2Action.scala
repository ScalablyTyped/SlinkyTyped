/**
  * An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is
  * required to reproduce it.  `Action`s are the core component of the
  * [Execution] service. A single `Action` represents a repeatable action that
  * can be performed by the execution service. `Action`s can be succinctly
  * identified by the digest of their wire format encoding and, once an
  * `Action` has been executed, will be cached in the action cache. Future
  * requests can then use the cached result rather than needing to run afresh.
  * When a server completes execution of an Action, it MAY choose to cache the
  * result in the ActionCache unless `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD
  * expect the server to do so. By default, future calls to Execute the same
  * `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take
  * care to understand the caching behaviour. Ideally, all `Action`s will be
  * reproducible so that serving a result from cache is always desirable and
  * correct.

    * the client does not specify one, however, if the client does specify a
    * timeout that is longer than the server&#39;s maximum timeout, the server
    * MUST reject the request.  The timeout is a part of the Action message,
    * and therefore two `Actions` with different timeouts are different, even
    * if they are otherwise identical. This is because, if they were not,
    * running an `Action` with a lower timeout than is required might result in
    * a cache hit from an execution run with a longer timeout, hiding the fact
    * that the timeout is too short. By encoding it directly in the `Action`, a
    * lower timeout will result in a cache miss and the execution timeout will
    * fail immediately, rather than whenever the cache entry gets evicted.
