    * remotebuildexecution.watch
    * @desc Start a streaming RPC to get watch information from the server.
    * @alias remotebuildexecution.watch
    * @memberOf! ()
    *
    * @param {object} params Parameters for request
    * @param {string=} params.resumeMarker The `resume_marker` specifies how much of the existing underlying state is delivered to the client when the watch request is received by the system. The client can set this marker in one of the following ways to get different semantics:  *   Parameter is not specified or has the value "".     Semantics: Fetch initial state.     The client wants the entity's initial state to be delivered. See the     description in "Initial State".  *   Parameter is set to the string "now" (UTF-8 encoding).     Semantics: Fetch new changes only.     The client just wants to get the changes received by the system after     the watch point. The system may deliver changes from before the watch     point as well.  *   Parameter is set to a value received in an earlier     `Change.resume_marker` field while watching the same entity.     Semantics: Resume from a specific point.     The client wants to receive the changes from a specific point; this     value must correspond to a value received in the `Change.resume_marker`     field. The system may deliver changes from before the `resume_marker`     as well. If the system cannot resume the stream from this point (e.g.,     if it is too far behind in the stream), it can raise the     `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error.  An implementation MUST support an unspecified parameter and the empty string "" marker (initial state fetching) and the "now" marker. It need not support resuming from a specific point.
    * @param {string=} params.target The `target` value **must** be a valid URL path pointing to an entity to watch. Note that the service name **must** be removed from the target field (e.g., the target field must say "/foo/bar", not "myservice.googleapis.com/foo/bar"). A client is also allowed to pass system-specific parameters in the URL that are only obeyed by some implementations. Some parameters will be implementation-specific. However, some have predefined meaning and are listed here:   * recursive = true|false [default=false]    If set to true, indicates that the client wants to watch all elements    of entities in the subtree rooted at the entity's name in `target`. For    descendants that are not the immediate children of the target, the    `Change.element` will contain slashes.     Note that some namespaces and entities will not support recursive    watching. When watching such an entity, a client must not set recursive    to true. Otherwise, it will receive an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error.  Normal URL encoding must be used inside `target`.  For example, if a query parameter name or value, or the non-query parameter portion of `target` contains a special character, it must be %-encoded.  We recommend that clients and servers use their runtime's URL library to produce and consume target values.
    * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
    * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
    * @return {object} Request object
