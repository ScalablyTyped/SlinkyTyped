    * When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult&#39;s

    * finding had its state changed, the finding&#39;s state remained
    * unchanged, or if the finding was added during the compare_duration period
    * of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time
    * - compare_duration) and read_time.  The state_change value is derived
    * based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time.
    * Intermediate state changes between the two times don&#39;t affect the
    * result. For example, the results aren&#39;t affected if the finding is
    * made inactive and then active again.  Possible &quot;state_change&quot;
    * values when compare_duration is specified:  * &quot;CHANGED&quot;:
    * indicates that the finding was present at the start of compare_duration,
    * but changed its state at read_time. * &quot;UNCHANGED&quot;: indicates
    * that the finding was present at the start of compare_duration and did not
    * change state at read_time. * &quot;ADDED&quot;:     indicates that the
    * finding was not present at the start                  of
    * compare_duration, but was present at read_time.  If compare_duration is
    * not specified, then the only possible state_change is &quot;UNUSED&quot;,
    * which will be the state_change set for all findings present at read_time.
    * If this field is set then `state_change` must be a specified field in
    * `group_by`.
