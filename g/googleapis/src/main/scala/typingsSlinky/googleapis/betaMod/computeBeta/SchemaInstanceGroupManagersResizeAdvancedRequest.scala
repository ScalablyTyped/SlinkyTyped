    * instead. If the flag is false, the group attempts to recreate each
    * instance continuously until it succeeds.  This flag matters only in the
    * first attempt of creation of an instance. After an instance is
    * successfully created while this flag is enabled, the instance behaves the

    * request. In particular, if a running instance dies unexpectedly at a

    * recreation behavior in that scenario.  This flag is applicable only to
    * the current resize request. It does not influence other resize requests
    * in any way.  You can see which instances is being creating in which mode
    * by calling the get or listManagedInstances API.
