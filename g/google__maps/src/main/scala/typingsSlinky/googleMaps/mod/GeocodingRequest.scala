    *  - The geocoder does its best to provide a street address that is readable for both the user and locals.
    *    To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable
    *    by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language.
    *    Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.
    *  - If a name is not available in the preferred language, the geocoder uses the closest match.
    *  - The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return,
    *    and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
    *    such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.
    *    For example, utca and t√©r are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
