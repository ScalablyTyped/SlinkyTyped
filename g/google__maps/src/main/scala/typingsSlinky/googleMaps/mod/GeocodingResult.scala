    *  - The array does not necessarily include all the political entities that contain an address,
    *    apart from those included in the `formatted_address`. To retrieve all the political entities that contain a specific address,
    *    you should use reverse geocoding, passing the latitude/longitude of the address as a parameter to the request.
    *  - The format of the response is not guaranteed to remain the same between requests.
    *    In particular, the number of `address_components` varies based on the address requested and can change
    *    over time for the same address. A component can change position in the array.
    *    The type of the component can change. A particular component may be missing in a later response.

    *
    * The formatted address is logically composed of one or more address components.
    * For example, the address "111 8th Avenue, New York, NY" consists of the following components: "111" (the street number),
    * "8th Avenue" (the route), "New York" (the city) and "NY" (the US state).

    * Do not parse the formatted address programmatically. Instead you should use the individual address components,
    * which the API response includes in addition to the formatted address field.

    *
    * Partial matches most often occur for street addresses that do not exist within the locality you pass in the request.
    * Partial matches may also be returned when a request matches two or more locations in the same locality.
    * For example, "21 Henr St, Bristol, UK" will return a partial match for both Henry Street and Henrietta Street.
    * Note that if a request includes a misspelled address component, the geocoding service may suggest an alternative address.
    * Suggestions triggered in this way will also be marked as a partial match.
