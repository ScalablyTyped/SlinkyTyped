    * The Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations using an HTTP request.
    *
    * With the Directions API, you can:
    *  - Search for directions for several modes of transportation, including transit, driving, walking or cycling.
    *  - Return multi-part directions using a series of waypoints.
    *  - Specify origins, destinations, and waypoints as text strings
    *    (e.g. "Chicago, IL" or "Darwin, NT, Australia"), or as latitude/longitude coordinates, or as place IDs.
    *
    * The API returns the most efficient routes when calculating directions. Travel time is the primary factor optimized,
    * but the API may also take into account other factors such as distance, number of turns and many more when deciding
    * which route is the most efficient.
    *
    * **Tip:** Calculating directions is a time and resource intensive task. Whenever possible, use the service to calculate
    * known addresses ahead of time and store the results in a
    * [**temporary cache**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/policies#pre-fetching-caching-or-storage-of-content)
    * of your own design.
    *
    * **Note:** This service is not designed to respond in real time to user input. For dynamic directions calculations
    * (for example, within a user interface element), consult the documentation for the
