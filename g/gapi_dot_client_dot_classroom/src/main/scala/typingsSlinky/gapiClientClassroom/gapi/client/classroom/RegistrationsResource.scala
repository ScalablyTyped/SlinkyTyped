    * best effort basis, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that it
    * exists and that Classroom has permission to publish to it.
    *
    * This method may return the following error codes:
    *
    * &#42; `PERMISSION_DENIED` if:
    * &#42; the authenticated user does not have permission to receive
    * notifications from the requested field; or
    * &#42; the credential provided does not include the appropriate scope for
    * the requested feed.
    * &#42; another access error is encountered.
    * &#42; `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if:
    * &#42; no `cloudPubsubTopic` is specified, or the specified
    * `cloudPubsubTopic` is not valid; or
    * &#42; no `feed` is specified, or the specified `feed` is not valid.
    * &#42; `NOT_FOUND` if:
    * &#42; the specified `feed` cannot be located, or the requesting user does
    * not have permission to determine whether or not it exists; or
    * &#42; the specified `cloudPubsubTopic` cannot be located, or Classroom has
    * not been granted permission to publish to it.
