    * an FTL-own storage project. Except for in rare cases, calling this method in parallel from multiple clients will only create a single bucket. In order
    * to avoid unnecessary storage charges, the bucket is configured to automatically delete objects older than 90 days.
    *
    * The bucket is created with the following permissions: - Owner access for owners of central storage project (FTL-owned) - Writer access for
    * owners/editors of customer project - Reader access for viewers of customer project The default ACL on objects created in the bucket is: - Owner access
    * for owners of central storage project - Reader access for owners/editors/viewers of customer project See Google Cloud Storage documentation for more
    * details.
    *
    * If there is already a default bucket set and the project can access the bucket, this call does nothing. However, if the project doesn't have the
    * permission to access the bucket or the bucket is deleted, a new bucket will be created.
    *
    * May return any canonical error codes, including the following:
    *
    * - PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project - Any error code raised by Google Cloud Storage
