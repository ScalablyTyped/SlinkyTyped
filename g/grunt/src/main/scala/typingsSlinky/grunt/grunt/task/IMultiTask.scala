    * tasks guide, and Grunt will handle all the details.

    * each object in that array. The this.files property will always be an array.
    * The src property will also always be an array, in case your task cares about multiple source
    * files per destination file.
    *
    * @note it's possible that nonexistent files might be included in src values,
    *       so you may want to explicitly test that source files exist before using them.
