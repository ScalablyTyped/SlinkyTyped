    * Backups are used for hot exit and to prevent data loss. Your `backup` method should persist the resource in
    * its current state, i.e. with the edits applied. Most commonly this means saving the resource to disk in
    * the `ExtensionContext.storagePath`. When VS Code reloads and your custom editor is opened for a resource,
    * your extension should first check to see if any backups exist for the resource. If there is a backup, your
    * extension should load the file contents from there instead of from the resource in the workspace.
    *
    * `backup` is triggered approximately one second after the the user stops editing the document. If the user
    * rapidly edits the document, `backup` will not be invoked until the editing stops.
    *
    * `backup` is not invoked when `auto save` is enabled (since auto save already persists the resource).
    *
    * @param document Document to backup.
    * @param context Information that can be used to backup the document.
    * @param cancellation Token that signals the current backup since a new backup is coming in. It is up to your
    * extension to decided how to respond to cancellation. If for example your extension is backing up a large file
    * in an operation that takes time to complete, your extension may decide to finish the ongoing backup rather
    * than cancelling it to ensure that VS Code has some valid backup.

    * Signal that an edit has occurred inside a custom editor.
    *
    * This event must be fired by your extension whenever an edit happens in a custom editor. An edit can be
    * anything from changing some text, to cropping an image, to reordering a list. Your extension is free to
    * define what an edit is and what data is stored on each edit.
    *
    * Firing `onDidChange` causes VS Code to mark the editors as being dirty. This is cleared when the user either
    * saves or reverts the file.
    *
    * Editors that support undo/redo must fire a `CustomDocumentEditEvent` whenever an edit happens. This allows
    * users to undo and redo the edit using VS Code's standard VS Code keyboard shortcuts. VS Code will also mark
    * the editor as no longer being dirty if the user undoes all edits to the last saved state.
    *
    * Editors that support editing but cannot use VS Code's standard undo/redo mechanism must fire a `CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent`.
    * The only way for a user to clear the dirty state of an editor that does not support undo/redo is to either
    * `save` or `revert` the file.
    *
    * An editor should only ever fire `CustomDocumentEditEvent` events, or only ever fire `CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent` events.
