    * It is possible to directly set the refractionPlane by directly using a Plane(a, b, c, d) where a, b and c give the plane normal vector (a, b, c) and d is a scalar displacement from the refractionPlane to the origin. However in all but the very simplest of situations it is more straight forward to set it to the refractor as stated in the doc.
