    * but also about developers of other plugins, who may also patch this method before or after you.
    * Try to change target method behaviour as little as possible, and avoid changing method signatures.
    * - Display name of patched method is changed, so you can see if a function has been patched (and how many times) while debugging or in the stack trace.
    * Also, patched methods have property `__monkeyPatched` set to `true`, in case you want to check something programmatically.
    * @param module Object to be patched. You can can also pass class prototypes to patch all class instances.
    * @param methodName The name of the target message to be patched.
    * @param options Options object. You should provide at least one of `before`, `after` or `instead` parameters. Other parameters are optional.
    * @param options.once Set to `true` if you want to automatically unpatch method after first call.
    * @param options.silent Set to `true` if you want to suppress log messages about patching and unpatching.
    * Useful to avoid clogging the console in case of frequent conditional patching/unpatching, for example from another monkeyPatch callback.
    * @param options.displayName You can provide meaningful name for class/object provided in `what` param for logging purposes.
    * By default, this function will try to determine name automatically.
    * @param options.before Callback that will be called before original target method call. You can modify arguments here, so it will be passed to original method.Can be combined with `after`.
    * @param options.after Callback that will be called after original target method call. You can modify return value here, so it will be passed to external code which calls target method.
    * Can be combined with `before`.
    * @param options.instead Callback that will be called instead of original target method call.
