  /**
    * Execute an action remotely. In order to execute an action, the client must first upload all of the inputs, the Command to run, and the Action into the ContentAddressableStorage. It
    * then calls `Execute` with an `action_digest` referring to them. The server will run the action and eventually return the result. The input `Action`'s fields MUST meet the various
    * canonicalization requirements specified in the documentation for their types so that it has the same digest as other logically equivalent `Action`s. The server MAY enforce the
    * requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is received. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the requirements, such as for performance reasons. If the
    * server does not verify the requirement, then it will treat the `Action` as distinct from another logically equivalent action if they hash differently. Returns a stream of
    * google.longrunning.Operation messages describing the resulting execution, with eventual `response` ExecuteResponse. The `metadata` on the operation is of type
    * ExecuteOperationMetadata. If the client remains connected after the first response is returned after the server, then updates are streamed as if the client had called WaitExecution
    * until the execution completes or the request reaches an error. The operation can also be queried using Operations API. The server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality
    * of the Operations API. Errors discovered during creation of the `Operation` will be reported as gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the action will be
    * reported in the `status` field of the `ExecuteResponse`. The server MUST NOT set the `error` field of the `Operation` proto. The possible errors include: * `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One
    * or more arguments are invalid. * `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: One or more errors occurred in setting up the action requested, such as a missing input or command or no worker being
    * available. The client may be able to fix the errors and retry. * `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: There is insufficient quota of some resource to run the action. * `UNAVAILABLE`: Due to a
    * transient condition, such as all workers being occupied (and the server does not support a queue), the action could not be started. The client should retry. * `INTERNAL`: An
    * internal error occurred in the execution engine or the worker. * `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The execution timed out. * `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled by the client. This status
    * is only possible if the server implements the Operations API CancelOperation method, and it was called for the current execution. In the case of a missing input or command, the
    * server SHOULD additionally send a PreconditionFailure error detail where, for each requested blob not present in the CAS, there is a `Violation` with a `type` of `MISSING` and a
    * `subject` of `"blobs/{hash}/{size}"` indicating the digest of the missing blob.
