    * When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult's "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or
    * if the finding was added during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The
    * state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For
    * example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates
    * that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present
    * and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. * "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or was not
    * present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the filter at the start of compare_duration,
    * but did not match the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set for all findings
    * present at read_time. If this field is set then `state_change` must be a specified field in `group_by`.

    * 1560208038000` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a
    * partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a
