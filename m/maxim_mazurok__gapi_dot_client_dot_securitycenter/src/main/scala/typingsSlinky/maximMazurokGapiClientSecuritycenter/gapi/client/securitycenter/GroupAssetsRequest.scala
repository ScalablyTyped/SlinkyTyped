    * When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult's "state_change" property is updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration
    * period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state change value is derived based on the presence of the
    * asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed and
    * re-created again. Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified: * "ADDED": indicates that the asset was not present at the start of compare_duration, but
    * present at reference_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at reference_time. * "ACTIVE": indicates that the
    * asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and reference_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
    * state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time. If this field is set then `state_change` must be a specified field in `group_by`.

    * in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` *
