    * ## Usage on the web
    *
    * To parse a document, you must create a new Readability object from a
    * DOM document object, and then call parse(). Here's an example:
    *
    * ```js
    * var article = new Readability(document).parse();
    * ```
    *
    * If you're using Readability on the web, you will likely be able to
    * use a document reference from elsewhere (e.g. fetched via XMLHttpRequest,
    * in a same-origin <iframe> you have access to, etc.).
    *
    * ## Usage from node.js
    *
    * In node.js, you won't generally have a DOM document object. To obtain one, you can use external
    * libraries like [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom). While this repository contains a parser of
    * its own (`JSDOMParser`), that is restricted to reading XML-compatible markup and therefore we do
    * not recommend it for general use.
    *
    * If you're using `jsdom` to create a DOM object, you should ensure that the page doesn't run (page)
    * scripts (avoid fetching remote resources etc.) as well as passing it the page's URI as the `url`
    * property of the `options` object you pass the `JSDOM` constructor.
    *
    * ```js
    * var JSDOM = require('jsdom').JSDOM;
    * var doc = new JSDOM("<body>Here's a bunch of text</body>", {
    *   url: "https://www.example.com/the-page-i-got-the-source-from",
    * });
    * let reader = new Readability(doc.window.document);
    * let article = reader.parse();
    * ```
