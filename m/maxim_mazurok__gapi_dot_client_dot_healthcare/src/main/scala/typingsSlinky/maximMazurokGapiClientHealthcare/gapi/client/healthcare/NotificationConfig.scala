    * The [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource
    * name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published.
    * Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service
    * account must have publisher permissions on the given Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can't
    * be published to Cloud Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing logs](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren't
    * submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub) for specific details.
