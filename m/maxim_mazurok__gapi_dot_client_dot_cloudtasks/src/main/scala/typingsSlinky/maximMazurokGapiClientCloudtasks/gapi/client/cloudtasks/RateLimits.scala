    * Output only. The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to
    * have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token
    * bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum
    * specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue's bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket
    * will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. Cloud Tasks will pick the value of `max_burst_size` based on the value of
    * max_dispatches_per_second. For queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to
    * [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). Since `max_burst_size` is output only, if UpdateQueue is called on a queue
    * created by `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` will be reset based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second, regardless of whether max_dispatches_per_second is updated.
