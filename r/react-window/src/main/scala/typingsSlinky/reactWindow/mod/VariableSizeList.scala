    * - smart
    *   - If the item is already visible, don't scroll at all.
    *   - If it is less than one viewport away, scroll as little as possible so that it becomes visible.
    *   - If it is more than one viewport away, scroll so that it is centered within the list.
    * - center - Center align the item within the list.
    * - end - Align the item to the end of the list (the bottom for vertical lists or the right for horizontal lists).
    * - start - Align the item to the beginning of the list (the top for vertical lists or the left for horizontal lists).
