    * - auto (default) - Scroll as little as possible to ensure the item is visible. (If the item is already visible, it won't scroll at all.)
    * - smart
    *   - If the item is already visible, don't scroll at all.

    *   - If it is more than one viewport away, scroll so that it is centered within the grid.
    * - center - Center align the item within the grid.
    * - end - Align the item to the bottom, right hand side of the grid.
    * - start - Align the item to the top, left hand of the grid.
