      * 2. The listener should not expect to see all states changes, as the state
      * might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
      * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
      * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest
      * state by the time it exits.
