    *   idea to keep actions serializable so you can record and replay user
    *   sessions, or use the time travelling `redux-devtools`. An action must
    *   have a `type` property which may not be `undefined`. It is a good idea
    *   to use string constants for action types.

    * @returns For convenience, the same action object you dispatched.

    *
    * 1. The subscriptions are snapshotted just before every `dispatch()` call.

    * progress. However, the next `dispatch()` call, whether nested or not,
    * will use a more recent snapshot of the subscription list.
    *
    * 2. The listener should not expect to see all states changes, as the state
    * might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
    * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
    * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest
    * state by the time it exits.
    *
    * @param listener A callback to be invoked on every dispatch.
    * @returns A function to remove this change listener.
