    * The global entry point for all features offered by the Raphaël library.
    *
    * Raphaël is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web. If you want
    * to create your own specific chart or image crop and rotate widget, for example, you can achieve it simply and
    * easily with this library.
    *
    * You use this library via the globally available {@link RaphaelStatic|Raphael} object:
    *
    * ```javascript
    * // Creates canvas 320 × 200 at 10, 50
    * var paper = Raphael(10, 50, 320, 200);
    *
    * // Creates circle at x = 50, y = 40, with radius 10
    * var circle = paper.circle(50, 40, 10);
    *
    * // Sets the fill attribute of the circle to red (#f00)
    * circle.attr("fill", "#f00");
    *
    * // Sets the stroke attribute of the circle to white
    * circle.attr("stroke", "#fff");
    * ```
    *
    * See https://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/
