  /**
    * Call this function when you have loaded the additional data requested.
    * You should set scrollUp and scrollDown to indicate whether there are still more pages in each direction.
    *
    * If you call dataLoaded without first calling saveScrollPercentage, then we will scroll the user to the
    * start of the newly loaded data.  This usually makes scrolling smooth, but be jumpy with large
    * infiniteScrollRowsFromEnd values, and on variable speed internet connections.
    * Using saveScrollPercentage as demonstrated in the tutorial should give a smoother scrolling experience
    * for users.
    *
    * See infinite_scroll tutorial for example of usage
    * @param {boolean} scrollUp if set to false flags that there are no more pages upwards, so don't fire any
    *        more infinite scroll events upward
    * @param {boolean} scrollDown if set to false flags that there are no more pages downwards, so don't fire
    *        any more infinite scroll events downward
    * @returns {ng.IPromise<any>} a promise that is resolved when the grid scrolling is fully adjusted.
    *          If you're planning to remove pages, you should wait on this promise first, or you'll break the
    *          scroll positioning
