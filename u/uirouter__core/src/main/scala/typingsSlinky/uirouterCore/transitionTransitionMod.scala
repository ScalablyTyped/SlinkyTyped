      * The injector provides resolve values which the target state has access to.
      *
      * The `UIInjector` can also provide values from the native root/global injector (ng1/ng2).
      *
      * #### Example:
      * ```js
      * .onEnter({ entering: 'myState' }, trans => {
      *   var myResolveValue = trans.injector().get('myResolve');
      *   // Inject a global service from the global/native injector (if it exists)
      *   var MyService = trans.injector().get('MyService');
      * })
      * ```
      *
      * In some cases (such as `onBefore`), you may need access to some resolve data but it has not yet been fetched.
      * You can use [[UIInjector.getAsync]] to get a promise for the data.
      * #### Example:
      * ```js
      * .onBefore({}, trans => {
      *   return trans.injector().getAsync('myResolve').then(myResolveValue =>
      *     return myResolveValue !== 'ABORT';
      *   });
      * });
      * ```
      *
      * If a `state` is provided, the injector that is returned will be limited to resolve values that the provided state has access to.
      * This can be useful if both a parent state `foo` and a child state `foo.bar` have both defined a resolve such as `data`.
      * #### Example:
      * ```js
      * .onEnter({ to: 'foo.bar' }, trans => {
      *   // returns result of `foo` state's `myResolve` resolve
      *   // even though `foo.bar` also has a `myResolve` resolve
      *   var fooData = trans.injector('foo').get('myResolve');
      * });
      * ```
      *
      * If you need resolve data from the exiting states, pass `'from'` as `pathName`.
      * The resolve data from the `from` path will be returned.
      * #### Example:
      * ```js
      * .onExit({ exiting: 'foo.bar' }, trans => {
      *   // Gets the resolve value of `myResolve` from the state being exited
      *   var fooData = trans.injector(null, 'from').get('myResolve');
      * });
      * ```
      *
      *
      * @param state Limits the resolves provided to only the resolves the provided state has access to.
      * @param pathName Default: `'to'`: Chooses the path for which to create the injector. Use this to access resolves for `exiting` states.
