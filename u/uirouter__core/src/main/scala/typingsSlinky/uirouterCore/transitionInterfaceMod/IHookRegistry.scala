  /**
    * Registers a [[TransitionHookFn]], called *before a transition starts*.
    *
    * Registers a transition lifecycle hook, which is invoked before a transition even begins.
    * This hook can be useful to implement logic which prevents a transition from even starting, such
    * as authentication, redirection
    *
    * See [[TransitionHookFn]] for the signature of the function.
    *
    * The [[HookMatchCriteria]] is used to determine which Transitions the hook should be invoked for.
    * To match all Transitions, use an empty criteria object `{}`.
    *
    * ### Lifecycle
    *
    * `onBefore` hooks are invoked *before a Transition starts*.
    * No resolves have been fetched yet.
    * Each `onBefore` hook is invoked synchronously, in the same call stack as [[StateService.transitionTo]].
    * The registered `onBefore` hooks are invoked in priority order.
    *
    * Note: during the `onBefore` phase, additional hooks can be added to the specific [[Transition]] instance.
    * These "on-the-fly" hooks only affect the currently running transition..
    *
    * ### Return value
    *
    * The hook's return value can be used to pause, cancel, or redirect the current Transition.
    * See [[HookResult]] for more information.
    *
    * If any hook modifies the transition *synchronously* (by throwing, returning `false`, or returning
    * a [[TargetState]]), the remainder of the hooks are skipped.
    * If a hook returns a promise, the remainder of the `onBefore` hooks are still invoked synchronously.
    * All promises are resolved, and processed asynchronously before the `onStart` phase of the Transition.
    *
    * ### Examples
    *
    * #### Default Substate
    *
    * This example redirects any transition from 'home' to 'home.dashboard'.  This is commonly referred to as a
    * "default substate".
    *
    * @example
    * ```js
    * // ng2
    * transitionService.onBefore({ to: 'home' }, (trans: Transition) =>
    *     trans.router.stateService.target("home.dashboard"));
    * ```
    *
    * #### Data Driven Default Substate
    *
    * This example provides data-driven default substate functionality. It matches on a transition to any state
    * which has `defaultSubstate: "some.sub.state"` defined.  See: [[Transition.to]] which returns the "to state"
    * definition.
    *
    * @example
    * ```js
    * // ng1
    * // state declaration
    * {
    *   name: 'home',
    *   template: '<div ui-view/>',
    *   defaultSubstate: 'home.dashboard'
    * }
    *
    * var criteria = {
    *   to: function(state) {
    *     return state.defaultSubstate != null;
    *   }
    * }
    *
    * $transitions.onBefore(criteria, function(trans: Transition) {
    *   var substate = trans.to().defaultSubstate;
    *   return trans.router.stateService.target(substate);
    * });
    * ```
    *
    *
    * #### Require authentication
    *
    * This example cancels a transition to a state which requires authentication, if the user is not currently authenticated.
    *
    * This example assumes a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'requireauth'` state.
    * This example assumes `MyAuthService` synchronously returns a boolean from `isAuthenticated()`.
    *
    * #### Example:
    * ```js
    * // ng1
    * $transitions.onBefore( { to: 'requireauth.**' }, function(trans) {
    *   var myAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');
    *   // If isAuthenticated returns false, the transition is cancelled.
    *   return myAuthService.isAuthenticated();
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.
    * @param callback the hook function which will be invoked.
    * @returns a function which deregisters the hook.

  /**
    * Registers a [[TransitionStateHookFn]], called when a specific state is entered.
    *
    * Registers a lifecycle hook, which is invoked (during a transition) when a specific state is being entered.
    *
    * Since this hook is run only when the specific state is being *entered*, it can be useful for

    * or for guarding access to a submodule/feature area.

    * `onEnter` hooks generally specify `{ entering: 'somestate' }`.
    * To match all Transitions, use an empty criteria object `{}`.
    *
    * ### Lifecycle
    *
    * `onEnter` hooks are invoked when the Transition is entering a state.
    * States are entered after the `onRetain` phase is complete.
    * If more than one state is being entered, the parent state is entered first.
    * The registered `onEnter` hooks for a state are invoked in priority order.
    *
    * Note: A built-in `onEnter` hook with high priority is used to fetch lazy resolve data for states being entered.
    *
    * ### Return value
    *
    * The hook's return value can be used to pause, cancel, or redirect the current Transition.
    * See [[HookResult]] for more information.
    *
    * ### Inside a state declaration
    *
    * Instead of registering `onEnter` hooks using the [[TransitionService]], you may define an `onEnter` hook
    * directly on a state declaration (see: [[StateDeclaration.onEnter]]).
    *
    *
    * ### Examples
    *
    * #### Audit Log
    *
    * This example uses a service to log that a user has entered the admin section of an app.
    * This assumes that there are substates of the "admin" state, such as "admin.users", "admin.pages", etc.
    * @example
    * ```
    *
    * $transitions.onEnter({ entering: 'admin' }, function(transition, state) {
    *   var AuditService = trans.injector().get('AuditService');
    *   AuditService.log("Entered " + state.name + " module while transitioning to " + transition.to().name);
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * #### Audit Log (inside a state declaration)
    *
    * The `onEnter` inside this state declaration is syntactic sugar for the previous Audit Log example.
    * ```
    * {
    *   name: 'admin',
    *   component: 'admin',
    *   onEnter: function($transition$, $state$) {
    *     var AuditService = $transition$.injector().get('AuditService');
    *     AuditService.log("Entered " + state.name + " module while transitioning to " + transition.to().name);
    *   }
    * }
    * ```
    *
    * Note: A state declaration's `onEnter` function is injected for Angular 1 only.
    *
    * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.
    * @param callback the hook function which will be injected and invoked.
    * @returns a function which deregisters the hook.

    * - A transition was redirected by a Transition Hook returning a [[TargetState]]
    * - A Transition Hook or resolve function threw an error
    * - A Transition Hook returned a rejected promise
    * - A resolve function returned a rejected promise
    *
    * To check the failure reason, inspect the return value of [[Transition.error]].
    *
    * Note: `onError` should be used for targeted error handling, or error recovery.

    *
    * ### Example
    *
    * #### Login during transition
    *
    * This example intercepts any transition to a state which requires authentication, when the user is
    * not currently authenticated.  It allows the user to authenticate asynchronously, then resumes the
    * transition.  If the user did not authenticate successfully, it redirects to the "guest" state, which
    * does not require authentication.
    *
    * This example assumes:
    * - a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'auth'` state.
    * - `MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()` synchronously returns a boolean.
    * - `MyAuthService.authenticate()` presents a login dialog, and returns a promise which is resolved
    *   or rejected, whether or not the login attempt was successful.
    *
    * #### Example:
    * ```js
    * // ng1
    * $transitions.onStart( { to: 'auth.**' }, function(trans) {
    *   var $state = trans.router.stateService;
    *   var MyAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');
    *
    *   // If the user is not authenticated
    *   if (!MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()) {
    *
    *     // Then return a promise for a successful login.
    *     // The transition will wait for this promise to settle
    *
    *     return MyAuthService.authenticate().catch(function() {
    *
    *       // If the authenticate() method failed for whatever reason,
    *       // redirect to a 'guest' state which doesn't require auth.
    *       return $state.target("guest");
