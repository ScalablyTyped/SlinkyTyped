/**
  * `L.esri.FeatureLayer` is used to visualize, style, query and edit vector geographic data hosted in both
  * ArcGIS Online and published using ArcGIS Server. Copyright text from the service is added to map attribution
  * automatically.
  *
  * Feature Layers reference an individual data source in either a parent Map Service or Feature Service that can
  * contain multiple layers. You can see a sample Map Service URL below:
  * http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Hurricanes/MapServer
  *
  * This particular service includes two different data sources. The URL for the 'Hurricane Tracks' feature layer
  * will end in a number (representing its position among the other layers).
  * http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Hurricanes/MapServer/1
  *
  * Feature Layer URLs always end in a number (ex: /FeatureServer/{LAYER_ID} or /MapServer/{LAYER_ID}).
  *
  * You can create a new empty feature service with a single layer on the ArcGIS for Developers website or you
  * can use ArcGIS Online to create a Feature Service from a CSV or Shapefile
  *
  * `L.esri.FeatureLayer` divides the current map extent into a grid of individual cells and uses them to fire
  * queries to fetch nearby features. This technique is comparable to `MODE_ONDEMAND` in the ArcGIS API for
  * JavaScript.
