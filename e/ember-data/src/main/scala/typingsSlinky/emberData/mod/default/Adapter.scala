  * An adapter is an object that receives requests from a store and
  * translates them into the appropriate action to take against your
  * persistence layer. The persistence layer is usually an HTTP API, but
  * may be anything, such as the browser's local storage. Typically the
  * adapter is not invoked directly instead its functionality is accessed
  * through the `store`.
