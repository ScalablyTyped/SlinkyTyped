  * An options object for creating a command.

  * A command is an abstract representation of code to be executed along
  * with metadata for describing how the command should be displayed in
  * a visual representation.
  *
  * A command is a collection of functions, *not* methods. The command
  * registry will always invoke the command functions with a `thisArg`
  * which is `undefined`.
