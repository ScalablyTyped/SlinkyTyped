      * Calculate the optimal layout sizes for a sequence of box sizers.
      *
      * This distributes the available layout space among the box sizers
      * according to the following algorithm:
      *
      * 1. Initialize the sizers's size to its size hint and compute the
      *    sums for each of size hint, min size, and max size.
      *
      * 2. If the total size hint equals the available space, return.
      *
      * 3. If the available space is less than the total min size, set all
      *    sizers to their min size and return.
      *
      * 4. If the available space is greater than the total max size, set
      *    all sizers to their max size and return.
      *
      * 5. If the layout space is less than the total size hint, distribute
      *    the negative delta as follows:
      *
      *    a. Shrink each sizer with a stretch factor greater than zero by
      *       an amount proportional to the negative space and the sum of
      *       stretch factors. If the sizer reaches its min size, remove
      *       it and its stretch factor from the computation.
      *
      *    b. If after adjusting all stretch sizers there remains negative
      *       space, distribute the space equally among the sizers with a
      *       stretch factor of zero. If a sizer reaches its min size,
      *       remove it from the computation.
      *
      * 6. If the layout space is greater than the total size hint,
      *    distribute the positive delta as follows:
      *
      *    a. Expand each sizer with a stretch factor greater than zero by
      *       an amount proportional to the postive space and the sum of
      *       stretch factors. If the sizer reaches its max size, remove
      *       it and its stretch factor from the computation.
      *
      *    b. If after adjusting all stretch sizers there remains positive
      *       space, distribute the space equally among the sizers with a
      *       stretch factor of zero. If a sizer reaches its max size,
      *       remove it from the computation.
      *
      * 7. return
      *
      * @param sizers - The sizers for a particular layout line.
      *
      * @param space - The available layout space for the sizers.
      *
      * @returns The delta between the provided available space and the
      *   actual consumed space. This value will be zero if the sizers
      *   can be adjusted to fit, negative if the available space is too
      *   small, and positive if the available space is too large.
      *
      * #### Notes
      * The [[size]] of each sizer is updated with the computed size.
      *
      * This function can be called at any time to recompute the layout for
      * an existing sequence of sizers. The previously computed results will
      * have no effect on the new output. It is therefore not necessary to
      * create new sizer objects on each resize event.
