  /**
    * Calculate the optimal layout sizes for a sequence of box sizers.
    *
    * This distributes the available layout space among the box sizers
    * according to the following algorithm:
    *
    * 1. Initialize the sizers's size to its size hint and compute the
    *    sums for each of size hint, min size, and max size.
    *
    * 2. If the total size hint equals the available space, return.
    *
    * 3. If the available space is less than the total min size, set all
    *    sizers to their min size and return.
    *
    * 4. If the available space is greater than the total max size, set
    *    all sizers to their max size and return.
    *
    * 5. If the layout space is less than the total size hint, distribute
    *    the negative delta as follows:
    *
    *    a. Shrink each sizer with a stretch factor greater than zero by
    *       an amount proportional to the negative space and the sum of
    *       stretch factors. If the sizer reaches its min size, remove
    *       it and its stretch factor from the computation.
    *
    *    b. If after adjusting all stretch sizers there remains negative
    *       space, distribute the space equally among the sizers with a
    *       stretch factor of zero. If a sizer reaches its min size,
    *       remove it from the computation.
    *
    * 6. If the layout space is greater than the total size hint,
    *    distribute the positive delta as follows:
    *
    *    a. Expand each sizer with a stretch factor greater than zero by
    *       an amount proportional to the postive space and the sum of
    *       stretch factors. If the sizer reaches its max size, remove
    *       it and its stretch factor from the computation.
    *
    *    b. If after adjusting all stretch sizers there remains positive
    *       space, distribute the space equally among the sizers with a
    *       stretch factor of zero. If a sizer reaches its max size,
    *       remove it from the computation.
    *
    * 7. return
    *
    * @param sizers - The sizers for a particular layout line.
    *
    * @param space - The available layout space for the sizers.
    *
    * @returns The delta between the provided available space and the
    *   actual consumed space. This value will be zero if the sizers
    *   can be adjusted to fit, negative if the available space is too
    *   small, and positive if the available space is too large.
    *
    * #### Notes
    * The [[size]] of each sizer is updated with the computed size.
    *
    * This function can be called at any time to recompute the layout for
    * an existing sequence of sizers. The previously computed results will
    * have no effect on the new output. It is therefore not necessary to
    * create new sizer objects on each resize event.
