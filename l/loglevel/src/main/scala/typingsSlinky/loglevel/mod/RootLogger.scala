    * getLogger() multiple times with the same name will return an identical logger object.
    * In large applications, it can be incredibly useful to turn logging on and off for particular modules as you are
    * working with them. Using the getLogger() method lets you create a separate logger for each part of your
    * application with its own logging level. Likewise, for small, independent modules, using a named logger instead
    * of the default root logger allows developers using your module to selectively turn on deep, trace-level logging
    * when trying to debug problems, while logging only errors or silencing logging altogether under normal
    * circumstances.
