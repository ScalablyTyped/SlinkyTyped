/**
  * A vector is used to construct the vector space of documents and queries. These
  * vectors support operations to determine the similarity between two documents or
  * a document and a query.
  *
  * Normally no parameters are required for initializing a vector, but in the case of
  * loading a previously dumped vector the raw elements can be provided to the constructor.
  *
  * For performance reasons vectors are implemented with a flat array, where an elements
  * index is immediately followed by its value. E.g. [index, value, index, value]. This
  * allows the underlying array to be as sparse as possible and still offer decent
  * performance when being used for vector calculations.
