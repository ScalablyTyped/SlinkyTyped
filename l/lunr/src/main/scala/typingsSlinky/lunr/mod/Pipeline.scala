/**
  * lunr.Pipelines maintain an ordered list of functions to be applied to all
  * tokens in documents entering the search index and queries being ran against
  * the index.
  *
  * An instance of lunr.Index created with the lunr shortcut will contain a
  * pipeline with a stop word filter and an English language stemmer. Extra
  * functions can be added before or after either of these functions or these
  * default functions can be removed.
  *
  * When run the pipeline will call each function in turn, passing a token, the
  * index of that token in the original list of all tokens and finally a list of
  * all the original tokens.
  *
  * The output of functions in the pipeline will be passed to the next function
  * in the pipeline. To exclude a token from entering the index the function
  * should return undefined, the rest of the pipeline will not be called with
  * this token.
  *
  * For serialisation of pipelines to work, all functions used in an instance of
  * a pipeline should be registered with lunr.Pipeline. Registered functions can
  * then be loaded. If trying to load a serialised pipeline that uses functions
  * that are not registered an error will be thrown.
  *
  * If not planning on serialising the pipeline then registering pipeline functions
  * is not necessary.
