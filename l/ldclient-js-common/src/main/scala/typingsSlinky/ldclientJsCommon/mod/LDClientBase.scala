    *   of whether it successfully connected to LaunchDarkly, or encountered an error
    *   and had to give up; to distinguish between these cases, see below.
    * - `"initialized"`: The client successfully started up and has valid feature flag
    *   data. This will always be accompanied by `"ready"`.
    * - `"failed"`: The client encountered an error that prevented it from connecting to
    *   LaunchDarkly, such as an invalid environment ID. All flag evaluations will
    *   therefore receive default values. This will always be accompanied by `"ready"`.
    * - `"error"`: General event for any kind of error condition during client operation.
    *   The callback parameter is an Error object. If you do not listen for "error"
    *   events, then the errors will be logged with `console.log()`.
    * - `"change"`: The client has received new feature flag data. This can happen either
    *   because you have switched users with [[identify]], or because the client has a
    *   stream connection and has received a live change to a flag value (see below).
    *   The callback parameter is an [[LDFlagChangeset]].
    * - `"change:FLAG-KEY"`: The client has received a new value for a specific flag
    *   whose key is `FLAG-KEY`. The callback receives two parameters: the current (new)
    *   flag value, and the previous value. This is always accompanied by a general
    *   `"change"` event as described above; you can listen for either or both.
    *
    * The `"change"` and `"change:FLAG-KEY"` events have special behavior: by default, the
    * client will open a streaming connection to receive live changes if and only if
    * you are listening for one of these events. This behavior can be overridden by
    * setting `streaming` in [[LDOptions]] or calling [[LDClient.setStreaming]].
    *
    * @param key
    *   The name of the event for which to listen.
    * @param callback
    *   The function to execute when the event fires. The callback may or may not
    *   receive parameters, depending on the type of event; see [[LDEventSignature]].
    * @param context
    *   The `this` context to use for the callback.
