    * {Object} [logOnAs]
    * If you need to specify a specific user or particular credentials for the service log on as once installed, the following
    * attributes may be helpful.
    *
    * The `logOnAs` attribute is an object with four keys: `domain`,`account`, `password`, and `mungeCredentialsAfterInstall`.
    * This can be used to identify which user the service should run as once installed.
    *
    * If no account and password is specified, the logOnAs property is not used and the service will run as the "Local System" account.
    * If account and password is specified, but domain is not specified then the domain is set to the local computer name, but it can be overridden with an Active Directory
    * or LDAP domain. For example:
    *
    * **app.js**
    *
    *     var Service = require('node-windows').Service;
    *
    *     // Create a new service object

    *     svc.logOnAs.password = 'password';
    *     ...

    * Both the account and password must be explicitly defined if you want the service to log on as that user,
    * otherwise the Local System account will be used.
