    * All images in the jQuery object will be bound. The specific example
    * above will attempt to bind to all images present on the page. Each image
    * must be bound to an image map identified with the usemap attribute. If
    * there is no usemap attribute, or it does not refer to a valid map, then
    * the image will be ignored. Therefore you can use this syntax to activate
    * all imagemaps on a page. Because pages often contain many images,
    * though, it will be faster to select just the image you are targeting
    * using a more specific selector.
    *
    * Images are often not completely loaded when script execution begins.
    * ImageMapster will ensure that all images are loaded before it permits
    * interaction from the client. If an alternate image is specified, this
    * will also be preloaded.
    *
    * Because images are loaded asynchronously, code execution will often
    * return to your script before the ImageMapster is available. If you apply
    * other methods to it (such as selecting or deselecting areas), these
    * commands will be queued until the image has been loaded, and then
    * executed automatically. So you don't need to worry about using callbacks
    * for initial configuration. You can assign a function to a callback when
    * configuration is complete if needed to perform other setup activities on
    * the page.

  /**
    * keys: get the primary mapKey (or comma-separated list of keys) for an
    * area, set of areas, or key group. Version 1.2.4.050
    *
    * This method allows you to obtain the primary mapKey (or keys) associated
    * with another key, or one or more areas. If the all parameter is true,
    * the method returns all keys or groups that include the area.
    *

    * associated with a map area. It's also possible for an area to be
    * highlighted from code as part of a group, but be inaccessible to the
    * end-user. This is because area groups are separate physical entities
    * from the areas defined by their primary key. They can have different
    * options, and are highlighted independently. Note: the way area groups
    * work is not well documented here yet. I am working on a more
    * comprehensive tutorial for the site. In the meantime please see this
    * example which describes area groups in detail, and shows how they work
    * through an active demonstration.
    *
    * There are reasons you may want to be able to access the primary keys
    * that make up an area group directly. Perhaps you want to select a group
    * of areas using the options from a group - but not as a separate group.
    * Perhaps you want to be able to compare the area clicked against a group
    * you have defined to take some action if the area is a member of a
    * certain group. This method provides access to that information.
    *
    * This method allows working with groups in a variety of ways by providing
    * access to a complete list of primary keys in any group, or all keys
    * which contain a given primary key.

    * them, the actual DOM elements must be removed.
    *
    * Notes: When a mapster is first bound, several things happen. A div
    * element is created which wraps the image. A copy is made of the original
    * image, and the original image is set be transparent. This allows
    * creating visible elements for the selections & highlights without

    * restores the image to its original visibility state, and releases
    * internal resources. When using 'preserveState', the internal resources
    * are cleaned up and event handling is disabled, but HTML elements are not
    * removed. Each element created by ImageMapster is assigned a class of
    * "mapster_el", which can be used to target them for later removal, though
    * it is not easy to complete this process manually because of the wrapper
    * and styles applied during configuration, which will be left intact when
    * using "preserveState."
