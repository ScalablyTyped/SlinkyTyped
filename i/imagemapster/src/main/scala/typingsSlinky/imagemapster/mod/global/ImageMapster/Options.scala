    * when any of these areas is activated. If you don't want this

    * grouping is applied.
    *
    * When mapKey is present, any area tags that are missing this
    * attribute will be excluded from the image map e ntirely. This is
    * functionally identical to setting staticState=false for these areas,
    * except they will be inaccessible through the API.
    *
    * ImageMapster will work with any attribute you identify as a key. If
    * you wish to maintain HTML compliance, it's recommeded that you use
    * attribute names starting with "data-", for example, data-mapkey. Any
    * such names are legal for the HTML5 document type. If you are using

    * than one group. The area may have different options in the context
    * of each group. When the area is physically moused over, the first

    * effect is removed immediately. This behavior can be changed with
    * this option. Setting it to a positive number causes a delay of n
    * milliseconds before the effect is removed. Setting to -1 causes the
    * effect to remain active until another hotspot is entered (e.g., it
    * will only be removed when superceded by a different area being
    * highlighted).

    * When using mouseoutDelay, the onMouseover event will still be fired
    * at the time the user's mouse pointer leaves the area. However, the
    * onStateChange event will be delayed until the highlight is actually
    * removed.
    *
    * Whether or not you are using mouseoutDelay, only one area can be
    * highlighted at a time. That is, whenever the mouse pointer moves
    * onto a new active area, any previously highlighted area will become
    * un-highlighted, regardless of any delay in effect. Hovering over a
    * new area will always supercede any delay and cause the new area (and
