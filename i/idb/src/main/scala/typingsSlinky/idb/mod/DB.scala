    * If you need to access only one object store, you can specify its name as a string.
    * @param mode Optional. The types of access that can be performed in the transaction. Transactions are opened in one of three modes: 'readonly' or 'readwrite'. 'versionchange' mode can't be specified here. If you don't provide the parameter, the default access mode is readonly. To avoid slowing things down, don't open a readwrite transaction unless you actually need to write into the database.
